## Early Usage
Intravenous vitamin C as a treatment for cancer was [first studied](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC431183/)<sup>1</sup> in the 1970s by [Nobel Prize winning](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1962/pauling-facts.html)<sup>2</sup> biochemist, Linus Pauling (1901 – 1994). Pauling asserted that vitamin C is an essential factor for mounting a resistance to cancerous cells and malignancy. He believed that the reason cancer patients are deficient in vitamin C is because of their increased [requirement and utilization](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/39/3/663.full.pdf)<sup>3</sup> of the vitamin.

## Modern Usage
More recently, intravenous vitamin C for the treatment of cancer has been studied by [McGill University](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/174/7/937.full)<sup>4</sup> and adopted by the [University of Kansas](http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/integrative-medicine/patient-services/infusion-clinic.html)<sup>5</sup>, where patients are treated with intravenous vitamin C on a daily basis. This treatment has also been championed by [Dr. Hugh Riordan MD](http://www.riordanclinic.org/who-we-are/founders-stories/hugh-d-riordan/)<sup>6</sup>, who has published several studies<sup>[7,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16570523)</sup><sup>[8,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15377059)</sup><sup>[9,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14619456)</sup><sup>[10,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7609676)</sup><sup>[11,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15313465)</sup><sup>[12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12013679)</sup> on the use of intravenous vitamin C for cancer.

## How Does Vitamin C Affect Cancer?
Proposed mechanism of action of vitamin C in the treatment of cancer.

### Hydrogen Peroxide Formation
- Vitamin C is a potent [anti-oxidant](http://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/corefacilities/esr/publications/buettnerpubs/pdf/ABB-1993-300-535-GRB.pdf)<sup>16</sup>, meaning that it helps to prevent damage to our cells from unstable (oxidizing) molecules.
- However, at high concentrations, vitamin C acts as a selective pro-oxidant, delivering hydrogen peroxide directly to cancer cells, while non-cancerous cells are [left](http://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/corefacilities/esr/publications/buettnerpubs/pdf/ABB-1993-300-535-GRB.pdf) [unaffected](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14813261)<sup>[16,](http://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/corefacilities/esr/publications/buettnerpubs/pdf/ABB-1993-300-535-GRB.pdf)</sup><sup>[17](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14813261)</sup>. Hydrogen peroxide is an unstable molecule which will cause cell damage and cell death if it accumulates.
- Several researchers have suggested that hydrogen peroxide accumulation is the mechanism by which intravenous vitamin C affects cancer cells<sup>[18,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157892)</sup><sup>[19,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15313465)</sup><sup>[20](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22728050)</sup>.
- Cancer cell sensitivity to vitamin C and hydrogen peroxide may be due to their low levels of [anti-oxidant enzymes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018733)<sup>[21](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018733)</sup>.

### Collagen Formation
Vitamin C is also necessary for the formation of collagen, an essential component of the [extra-cellular matrix](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC335576/)<sup>[22](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC335576/)</sup>, which serves as a physical barrier to the spread of cancer cells<sup>[23](http://cgp.iiarjournals.org/content/4/5/319.full.pdf)</sup>. It has been suggested that vitamin C’s collagen building and maintaining properties are an important part of its anti-cancer properties<sup>[24](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/371790)</sup>.
