Cholesterol-lowering medications (statins) are a very widely used class of prescription drugs. A large scale survey of USA citizens in 2010 found that 11.6% of participants had taken a cholesterol-lowering medication within the past 30 days<sup>1</sup>. This was more than any other type of medication. A similar pattern was seen in Canada in 2010, with two cholesterol lowering medications being the 2nd and 3rd most commonly filled prescriptions nationally<sup>2</sup>.

## Cholesterol & Heart Health
Although cholesterol lowering medications can be protective for individuals at high risk of having a heart attack, there is little evidence to justify their use for people who are at [moderate to low risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12479764)<sup>3</sup> of having a heart attack. Evidence has also pointed to low cholesterol in elderly people being associated with [earlier death](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2801%2905553-2/fulltext)<sup>4</sup>. Considering how widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering medications are, this is concerning.
Reliability of blood cholesterol as a measure of cardiovascular health is at once widely accepted and [intensely scrutinized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19560285)<sup>5</sup>. Strict limiting of dietary cholesterol is a mainstay treatment of the western medical model for preventing further narrowing of arteries and preventing heart attacks. However, dietary cholesterol intake has a small impact on blood cholesterol levels and also a [small impact on heart attack risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16596800)<sup>6</sup>. While a proper diet is very important for cardiovascular health, eliminating cholesterol is not the answer.

## Risks of Cholesterol-lowering Medications
Cholesterol lowering medications are not without adverse effects. One recent study has found that people taking cholesterol-lowering medications are significantly more likely to develop [muscle pains, joint dislocations, sprains, strains and joint degeneration](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/1691918)<sup>7</sup>. In practice I often see people with injuries or in pain that are sidelined due to not being able to exercise like they used to. Exercise is an incredibly important factor in controlling body weight, blood pressure and maintaining health in general.
One cholesterol lowering medication, simvastatin, has also been found to significantly reduce the [ability of exercise to increase physical fitness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23583255)<sup>8</sup>, which is alarming considering the importance of physical fitness in heart health.
Another study has recently found that higher dosages of a cholesterol lowering medication, atorvastatin, significantly [increases the risk of developing diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219296)<sup>9</sup> in people at moderate to high risk of developing diabetes. The risk increase was 24%, which is no small amount.

## Natural Cholesterol Reducers
There are many excellent foods which can help reduce cholesterol, including nuts, such as almonds. Making raw, unsalted almonds a part of your diet can effectively help to [control cholesterol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21421296)<sup>10</sup> and also help with [weight loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14574348)<sup>11</sup>. I use almonds as an example not because they are the only "anti-cholesterol" food but as proof that even small dietary changes can have a very real impact on cholesterol.

## Alternative Heart Health Measurements
Another firmly established predictor of cardiovascular health, is [waist circumference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19639001)<sup>12</sup>. In practice, my tape measure gets as much use as any other assessment tool that I have. While I always like to see patients’ recent cholesterol blood tests, a simple measure of waist circumference can be equally valuable, at the very least.
Again, while blood cholesterol levels can be a useful tool in monitoring cardiovascular health, they are not the be-all, end-all. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood sugar and body fat percentage are all important factors in monitoring cardiovascular health. It is a good idea to talk with your naturopathic doctor about cholesterol and how to best optimize your cardiovascular health.
