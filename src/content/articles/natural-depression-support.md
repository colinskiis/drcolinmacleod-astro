## Understanding Depression: More Than Just Feeling Sad

Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions in the world, affecting more than 280 million people globally according to the World Health Organization<sup>1</sup>. In Canada, approximately 5.4% of the population experiences a major depressive episode each year, making it a significant public health concern that touches individuals and families across Halifax, Nova Scotia and beyond<sup>2</sup>.

Yet despite its prevalence, depression remains widely misunderstood. Many people confuse the clinical condition with ordinary sadness, the kind we all experience after a loss, disappointment, or difficult life event. While sadness is a normal human emotion that typically lifts with time, clinical depression is something fundamentally different. It is a persistent state that affects how a person thinks, feels, and functions in daily life, often lasting weeks, months, or even years without appropriate treatment.

The experience of depression varies considerably from person to person. Some individuals describe it as a heavy fog that dulls their perception of the world, making it difficult to feel pleasure or motivation. Others experience profound fatigue that makes even simple tasks feel insurmountable. For many, depression brings persistent feelings of worthlessness, excessive guilt, or a sense that life has lost its meaning. Physical symptoms are common as well, including changes in appetite and weight, disrupted sleep patterns, difficulty concentrating, and unexplained aches and pains.

What makes depression particularly challenging is that it often convinces those affected that their negative perceptions are accurate reflections of reality. The condition can create a self-reinforcing cycle where depressive thinking leads to withdrawal from activities and relationships, which in turn deepens the depression. This is why professional support is so important, as an outside perspective can help individuals recognize that their depression is a treatable condition rather than an accurate assessment of their circumstances.

## The Biology of Mood: What Happens in Depression

For decades, the dominant understanding of depression focused almost exclusively on neurotransmitter imbalances, particularly the idea that depression results from insufficient serotonin in the brain. This "chemical imbalance" theory led to the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and remains influential in how many people understand the condition.

However, contemporary neuroscience reveals a far more complex picture. While neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine certainly play important roles in mood regulation, depression appears to involve multiple interconnected systems throughout the body<sup>3</sup>.

Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to form new neural connections and adapt to experience, is now recognized as central to understanding both depression and recovery. Research shows that chronic stress and depression are associated with reduced neuroplasticity in key brain regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These changes can impair emotional regulation, memory, and executive function. Conversely, effective treatments for depression, whether pharmaceutical, psychological, or lifestyle-based, appear to work in part by enhancing neuroplasticity and allowing the brain to form healthier patterns of activity<sup>4</sup>.

Inflammation has emerged as another crucial factor in depression. Multiple studies have found that people with depression often have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, including C-reactive protein and various inflammatory cytokines<sup>5</sup>. This inflammatory state appears to affect brain function directly and may help explain why depression so often co-occurs with inflammatory conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. The relationship appears to be bidirectional: inflammation can contribute to depression, and depression can promote inflammation, creating another self-reinforcing cycle.

The [gut-brain connection](/articles/gut-brain-connection-mental-health) represents one of the most exciting areas of depression research in recent years. The gut microbiome, the trillions of bacteria living in your digestive tract, produces neurotransmitters, influences inflammatory signaling, and communicates directly with the brain through the vagus nerve. Studies have found that people with depression tend to have different microbiome compositions than those without, with reduced diversity and alterations in specific bacterial species<sup>6</sup>. While we cannot yet say definitively that gut health causes or prevents depression, the evidence strongly suggests that digestive wellness is an important piece of the mental health puzzle.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, your body's central stress response system, is frequently dysregulated in depression. Many people with depression show abnormal cortisol patterns, whether elevated cortisol overall, a flattened cortisol rhythm, or an impaired ability to return cortisol to baseline after stress. This chronic stress activation can affect sleep, metabolism, immune function, and brain health, creating additional challenges for recovery<sup>7</sup>.

## Contributing Factors: What Underlies Depression

Depression rarely has a single cause. Instead, it typically emerges from the interaction of genetic predispositions, life experiences, and physiological factors. Understanding these contributors can help guide a more comprehensive approach to treatment and prevention.

Nutritional status plays a surprisingly important role in mental health. Research has identified several nutrients whose deficiency is associated with increased depression risk. These include B vitamins, particularly folate and B12 which are essential for neurotransmitter synthesis and methylation processes. Vitamin D deficiency is remarkably common in northern latitudes like Nova Scotia, where limited winter sunlight makes it difficult to maintain adequate levels, and has been consistently associated with depression in research studies<sup>8</sup>. Iron deficiency, even without overt anemia, can cause fatigue and mood changes. Omega-3 fatty acids are critical components of brain cell membranes and appear to have anti-inflammatory and mood-supporting effects. Zinc and magnesium are involved in hundreds of enzymatic reactions including those related to neurotransmitter function.

Thyroid function deserves special attention in any evaluation of depression. The thyroid gland regulates metabolism throughout the body, including the brain, and even subtle thyroid dysfunction can significantly impact mood and energy. Research suggests that a substantial percentage of people with treatment-resistant depression have undiagnosed thyroid issues<sup>9</sup>. Standard thyroid testing may miss some cases because it typically includes only TSH, and sometimes not the full picture of thyroid function. Comprehensive testing can help identify thyroid contributions to mood symptoms that might otherwise be overlooked.

Hormonal factors beyond thyroid function can also influence depression risk. Fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone contribute to premenstrual dysphoric disorder and postpartum depression. The decline in hormones during perimenopause and menopause is associated with increased vulnerability to depression in some women. Testosterone deficiency in men has been linked to depressive symptoms, fatigue, and reduced quality of life. For individuals whose depression seems connected to hormonal transitions or who have other signs of hormonal imbalance, [comprehensive hormone testing](/articles/comprehensive-hormone-testing-halifax) can provide valuable information for treatment planning.

Blood sugar dysregulation is increasingly recognized as a factor in mood disorders. The brain is highly sensitive to fluctuations in glucose availability, and the roller coaster of blood sugar spikes and crashes that accompanies a diet high in refined carbohydrates can contribute to mood instability, anxiety, and fatigue. Research has found bidirectional relationships between depression and insulin resistance, with each condition increasing risk for the other<sup>10</sup>.

Chronic stress and trauma are among the most significant contributors to depression. Adverse childhood experiences, ongoing life stressors, and traumatic events can create lasting changes in brain structure and function, stress response systems, and inflammatory processes. Addressing trauma and building stress resilience are often essential components of comprehensive depression treatment.

## The Role of Diet and Nutrition in Mood

The emerging field of nutritional psychiatry has produced compelling evidence that what we eat significantly affects how we feel. This should perhaps not be surprising. The brain, despite representing only about 2% of body weight, consumes approximately 20% of our daily energy and has extraordinarily high requirements for specific nutrients. Yet many people consume diets that fail to meet these needs.

Large epidemiological studies have consistently found that dietary patterns characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, and olive oil are associated with significantly lower rates of depression compared to typical Western dietary patterns high in processed foods, refined grains, sugar, and red meat<sup>11</sup>. The Mediterranean diet in particular has shown protective effects against depression in multiple studies.

More importantly, intervention studies have demonstrated that dietary change can actually improve depression symptoms. The landmark SMILES trial published in BMC Medicine randomized people with moderate to severe depression to receive either dietary support or social support over 12 weeks. The dietary intervention, which focused on a modified Mediterranean diet, produced significantly greater improvements in depression scores, with 32% of the diet group achieving remission compared to 8% of the social support group<sup>12</sup>. These are meaningful effect sizes comparable to many pharmaceutical and psychological interventions.

Several mechanisms may explain how diet affects mood. Nutrient-dense whole foods provide the building blocks for neurotransmitter synthesis. Anti-inflammatory dietary patterns reduce the systemic inflammation associated with depression. Fiber-rich plant foods support a healthy gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis. Stable blood sugar from complex carbohydrates and adequate protein prevents the mood crashes associated with refined carbohydrate consumption. Adequate omega-3 fatty acids support brain structure and function while reducing inflammation.

Working with a practitioner trained in [clinical nutrition](/clinical-nutrition) can help you identify dietary patterns that may be contributing to mood symptoms and develop sustainable changes that support mental health alongside physical wellbeing.

## Lifestyle Factors: The Foundation of Mental Health

While they may seem simple, lifestyle factors form the foundation upon which mental health is built. No amount of supplements or medications can fully compensate for inadequate sleep, sedentary behavior, or social isolation. Conversely, optimizing these fundamental areas can significantly improve mood even in the absence of other interventions.

Physical exercise may be the single most powerful lifestyle medicine for depression. The evidence base is remarkable: a 2023 meta-analysis of 218 studies involving over 14,000 participants concluded that exercise was 1.5 times more effective than either medication or cognitive behavioral therapy for depression<sup>13</sup>. Walking, running, resistance training, yoga, and other forms of physical activity have all shown benefits. The mechanisms are multiple, including increased neurotrophic factors that support brain health, reduced inflammation, improved sleep, enhanced self-efficacy, and acute effects on neurotransmitter systems. While any movement is better than none, research suggests that moderate-intensity exercise performed regularly produces the greatest benefits.

Sleep and depression have a bidirectional relationship. Depression commonly disrupts sleep, causing either insomnia or excessive sleeping, while sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality increase vulnerability to depression. [Sleep optimization](/articles/sleep-optimization-evidence-based-strategies) should be a priority for anyone struggling with mood symptoms. This means maintaining consistent sleep and wake times, creating a dark and cool sleep environment, limiting caffeine and alcohol, managing light exposure to support circadian rhythm, and addressing conditions like sleep apnea that fragment sleep.

Light exposure affects mood through its influence on circadian rhythm, melatonin production, and brain chemistry. Seasonal affective disorder represents the extreme end of this sensitivity, but most people experience some mood effects from the reduced daylight of winter months. Getting outdoor light exposure in the morning helps synchronize circadian rhythm and may boost serotonin production. For those in northern latitudes like Halifax where winter days are short and often overcast, light therapy using a specialized bright light box has good evidence for improving seasonal mood symptoms and may benefit non-seasonal depression as well<sup>14</sup>.

Social connection is fundamental to human wellbeing, yet depression often leads to withdrawal from relationships and activities. Research consistently shows that social isolation and loneliness are significant risk factors for depression, while strong social support is protective<sup>15</sup>. Breaking the cycle of isolation can be challenging when depression saps motivation and energy, but even small steps toward connection can begin to shift the pattern. This might mean reaching out to one trusted person, attending a group activity, or simply getting out of the house to be around others even without direct interaction.

Time in nature has demonstrated mental health benefits independent of the exercise that often accompanies it. Studies suggest that exposure to natural environments reduces stress hormones, lowers inflammatory markers, and improves mood<sup>16</sup>. Even brief periods in green spaces appear beneficial. For Halifax residents, the natural beauty of the waterfront, Point Pleasant Park, and surrounding areas offers accessible opportunities for nature exposure throughout the year.

Stress management practices like meditation, deep breathing, and yoga can reduce HPA axis activation, lower inflammation, and support emotional regulation. A growing body of research supports mindfulness-based interventions for depression, both for treatment and prevention of relapse<sup>17</sup>. Finding practices that resonate with you and building them into daily routine can provide meaningful support for mental health.

## The Naturopathic Approach: Complementary Care for Depression

Naturopathic medicine offers a whole-person approach to supporting mental health that can complement conventional treatment. Rather than viewing depression as a problem isolated to the brain, naturopathic care considers the interconnected systems that influence mood, including digestive function, nutritional status, hormonal balance, inflammation, and lifestyle factors.

A naturopathic approach to depression support typically begins with a thorough assessment to understand the individual's unique presentation. This includes detailed history-taking to understand the onset, course, and context of symptoms, as well as exploration of potential contributing factors like diet, sleep, stress, and medical history. Laboratory testing may be recommended to evaluate nutritional status, thyroid function, inflammatory markers, or other relevant parameters.

[Herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine) has a long tradition of use for mood support, and modern research has validated the efficacy of several botanical medicines for depression. Some herbs have been studied in rigorous clinical trials and shown benefits comparable to pharmaceutical antidepressants for mild to moderate depression, typically with fewer side effects. A qualified practitioner can help determine whether herbal support is appropriate for your situation and ensure safe use alongside any other medications.

Nutritional optimization addresses deficiencies that may be contributing to mood symptoms while ensuring the brain has adequate building blocks for neurotransmitter synthesis and healthy function. This may involve dietary modification, targeted nutrient repletion based on individual assessment, or both.

Support for related body systems often benefits mental health indirectly. Addressing digestive dysfunction, supporting healthy sleep, balancing blood sugar, and optimizing hormonal health can all contribute to improved mood even when they are not the primary treatment target.

Lifestyle guidance helps individuals implement the evidence-based lifestyle changes that support mental health. While the recommendations may seem straightforward on paper, actually integrating exercise, sleep hygiene, nutrition changes, and stress management into daily life often requires personalized support and accountability.

## An Important Note: When and How to Seek Help

If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, seeking appropriate help is essential. Depression is a serious condition that can significantly impact quality of life and, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. The natural approaches discussed in this article are meant to complement, not replace, conventional mental health care.

If your depression is moderate to severe, if you are having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or if your symptoms are significantly impairing your ability to function, please seek professional mental health support. This may include working with a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional. Pharmaceutical and psychological treatments have strong evidence bases and can be life-saving. Natural approaches work best as part of a comprehensive treatment plan developed with qualified healthcare providers.

For those in crisis, immediate resources are available. In Canada, the national crisis line can be reached by calling or texting 988. In Nova Scotia, the Mental Health Crisis Line operates 24 hours a day at 1-888-429-8167. If you are in immediate danger, please go to your nearest emergency department or call 911.

For those with milder symptoms or those looking to support their mental health preventatively, the lifestyle and nutritional approaches discussed here can provide meaningful benefits. However, if symptoms worsen or do not improve with these measures, seeking additional support is important. Depression tends to become more difficult to treat the longer it persists, so earlier intervention is generally better.

## Working Together for Mental Health

Mental health exists on a continuum, and most of us will experience periods of low mood at some point in our lives. Building habits that support mental health, including nourishing food, regular movement, adequate sleep, social connection, and stress management, creates a foundation of resilience that can help weather difficult times.

For those currently struggling with depression, know that effective help is available. The condition is highly treatable, and most people who receive appropriate care experience significant improvement. A combination of approaches often works best, and finding the right combination may take some time and experimentation.
