## Understanding Polycystic Ovary Syndrome

Polycystic ovary syndrome, commonly known as PCOS, is one of the most common hormonal disorders affecting women of reproductive age. It affects approximately 8-13% of women worldwide, though many cases remain undiagnosed<sup>1</sup>. In my naturopathic practice in Halifax, I regularly work with women struggling with PCOS and its wide-ranging effects on their health, fertility, and quality of life.

Despite its name, PCOS is not primarily an ovarian condition. It is a complex metabolic and hormonal disorder that affects multiple body systems. The ovarian cysts that give the condition its name are actually a symptom rather than the underlying cause. Understanding this distinction is crucial because effective treatment must address the root metabolic dysfunction, not just the surface symptoms.

The good news is that PCOS responds remarkably well to lifestyle and dietary interventions. While there is no cure, many women experience significant improvement in their symptoms through targeted natural approaches, sometimes avoiding the need for pharmaceutical intervention entirely. For others, natural therapies work synergistically with conventional treatments to provide better outcomes than either approach alone.

## The Diagnostic Criteria

PCOS is diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria, which require at least two of the following three features<sup>2</sup>:

**Irregular or absent ovulation**, which typically manifests as irregular menstrual cycles. Women with PCOS may have cycles longer than 35 days, fewer than eight periods per year, or no periods at all.

**Elevated androgens**, either through blood testing showing high levels of testosterone or other male hormones, or through clinical signs such as acne, hirsutism (excess hair growth on the face, chest, or back), or male-pattern hair thinning.

**Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound**, defined as 12 or more follicles in either ovary or increased ovarian volume. It is important to note that many women with PCOS do not have cysts, and many women with ovarian cysts do not have PCOS.

Other conditions that can mimic PCOS, such as thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, must be ruled out before diagnosis.

## The Four Phenotypes of PCOS

Not all PCOS presents the same way. Researchers have identified four distinct phenotypes<sup>3</sup>:

**Type A (Classic PCOS)** involves elevated androgens, irregular ovulation, and polycystic ovaries. This is the most common and typically most severe presentation.

**Type B (Classic non-PCO)** involves elevated androgens and irregular ovulation but without polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.

**Type C (Ovulatory PCOS)** involves elevated androgens and polycystic ovaries but with regular ovulation. These women may have acne and hirsutism but relatively regular cycles.

**Type D (Non-hyperandrogenic)** involves irregular ovulation and polycystic ovaries but without elevated androgens. These women may have irregular cycles and fertility challenges but fewer skin and hair symptoms.

Understanding which phenotype applies helps guide treatment. Type A and B tend to have stronger metabolic components and respond especially well to insulin-sensitizing interventions. Type C may benefit more from anti-androgen approaches. Type D may require different strategies altogether.

## The Root Causes: Beyond the Ovaries

### Insulin Resistance: The Central Player

Insulin resistance is present in approximately 70-80% of women with PCOS, regardless of body weight<sup>4</sup>. This is perhaps the most important concept to understand about the condition.

When cells become resistant to insulin, the pancreas produces more insulin to compensate. Elevated insulin levels directly stimulate the ovaries to produce excess androgens. High insulin also reduces production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), the protein that binds testosterone in the blood. With less SHBG, more free testosterone is available to cause symptoms.

Insulin resistance also promotes fat storage, particularly around the abdomen, and makes weight loss extremely difficult. This creates a vicious cycle: insulin resistance promotes weight gain, and excess weight worsens insulin resistance.

The good news is that improving insulin sensitivity through diet and lifestyle often produces dramatic improvements in PCOS symptoms, including more regular cycles, reduced androgen levels, clearer skin, and improved fertility.

### Chronic Inflammation

Women with PCOS tend to have elevated markers of chronic low-grade inflammation<sup>5</sup>. This inflammation appears to be both a cause and consequence of the condition, creating another self-perpetuating cycle.

Inflammatory cytokines impair insulin signaling, worsening insulin resistance. They also directly stimulate androgen production from the ovaries. Sources of inflammation in PCOS include excess visceral fat (which is metabolically active and produces inflammatory compounds), gut dysbiosis, dietary factors, and the hormonal imbalances themselves.

Anti-inflammatory dietary and lifestyle approaches can help break this cycle.

### Gut Microbiome Dysfunction

Emerging research has identified significant differences in gut bacteria composition between women with PCOS and healthy controls<sup>6</sup>. The gut microbiome influences PCOS through multiple pathways.

Gut bacteria affect how we metabolize and recycle hormones, including estrogens and androgens. Dysbiosis (imbalanced gut bacteria) promotes intestinal permeability, sometimes called "leaky gut," which drives inflammation. The microbiome also influences insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Certain gut bacteria produce compounds that affect appetite, blood sugar regulation, and fat storage.

This gut-hormone connection explains why women with PCOS often experience digestive symptoms and why addressing gut health can improve hormonal balance. For more on this topic, see my article on [the gut-brain connection](/articles/gut-brain-connection-mental-health).

### Adrenal Androgen Production

While the ovaries produce most androgens in PCOS, the adrenal glands also contribute. Some women have primarily adrenal-driven androgen excess, which may respond differently to treatment than ovarian-driven elevation.

Chronic stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increasing cortisol and DHEA-S (an adrenal androgen). Women with high-stress lives may find that stress management is essential for improving their PCOS.

## Dietary Approaches to PCOS

Diet is arguably the most powerful intervention for PCOS. The goal is to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and support healthy hormone metabolism.

### Low Glycemic Eating

Choosing foods that produce a gradual, modest rise in blood sugar rather than rapid spikes is fundamental to PCOS management. Low glycemic eating improves insulin sensitivity, reduces insulin levels, and often leads to decreased androgen production and more regular cycles<sup>7</sup>.

Practical applications include choosing whole grains over refined grains (brown rice, quinoa, steel-cut oats instead of white rice, white bread, instant oatmeal). Eat vegetables and protein before carbohydrates at meals. Include protein and healthy fat with every meal and snack. Avoid sugary drinks, including fruit juice. Limit refined sugars and processed foods. Choose whole fruits over fruit juice, and pair fruit with protein or nuts.

### Anti-Inflammatory Foods

Emphasizing anti-inflammatory foods while reducing inflammatory ones can help address the chronic inflammation underlying PCOS.

Foods to emphasize include fatty fish rich in omega-3s (salmon, sardines, mackerel), olive oil, nuts and seeds (especially walnuts and flaxseeds), colorful vegetables and berries high in polyphenols, turmeric and ginger, and green tea.

Foods to reduce include processed and fried foods, refined sugars and carbohydrates, industrial seed oils (corn, soybean, canola), excessive red meat, and alcohol.

### Adequate Protein

Protein improves satiety, stabilizes blood sugar, and supports muscle mass, which improves metabolic health. Many women with PCOS benefit from slightly higher protein intake, distributed throughout the day.

Good protein sources include fish and seafood, poultry, eggs, legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans), Greek yogurt, and nuts and seeds.

### Fiber for Hormone Balance

Dietary fiber is particularly important in PCOS for several reasons. Fiber slows glucose absorption, improving blood sugar control. Soluble fiber binds excess hormones in the gut, aiding their elimination. Fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria, supporting microbiome health. High-fiber foods are typically lower glycemic and more satiating.

Most women should aim for at least 25-30 grams of fiber daily from vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fruits. For more on fiber's benefits, see my article on [fiber and gut health](/articles/fiber-the-underrated-nutrient).

### Dairy Considerations

The relationship between dairy and PCOS is complex. Some research suggests dairy may worsen insulin resistance and androgen levels in some women, possibly due to hormones present in milk or dairy's effects on insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)<sup>8</sup>.

I recommend an individualized approach. Some women with PCOS do well with moderate dairy consumption, while others notice improvement in their skin and cycles when they reduce or eliminate it. A trial elimination period of 3-4 weeks can help determine your individual response.

## Lifestyle Interventions

### Exercise: The Evidence-Based Prescription

Regular physical activity is one of the most effective interventions for PCOS. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss, reduces androgens, and promotes regular ovulation<sup>9</sup>.

Both aerobic exercise and resistance training provide benefits. Resistance training builds muscle mass, which improves metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity. Aerobic exercise directly improves cardiovascular health and insulin sensitivity. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has shown particularly promising results for improving insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, though any sustainable exercise routine is beneficial.

The key is consistency. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly, including both cardiovascular and strength components. Find activities you enjoy, as you are more likely to maintain them long-term.

### Sleep and Circadian Health

Sleep quality significantly affects PCOS. Poor sleep worsens insulin resistance, increases inflammation, promotes weight gain, and disrupts hormonal balance<sup>10</sup>. Women with PCOS have higher rates of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea.

Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly. Maintain consistent sleep and wake times. Limit screen exposure in the evening. Keep the bedroom cool and dark. Address sleep apnea if present, as treatment can improve PCOS symptoms.

For more on optimizing sleep, see my article on [evidence-based sleep strategies](/articles/sleep-optimization-evidence-based-strategies).

### Stress Management

Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which worsens insulin resistance and can increase adrenal androgen production. Many women notice their PCOS symptoms worsen during stressful periods.

Effective stress management varies by individual but may include mindfulness meditation, yoga, time in nature, adequate rest, setting boundaries, and addressing sources of chronic stress. Regular practice matters more than the specific technique chosen.

### Weight Management: A Nuanced Approach

Weight loss, when appropriate, can significantly improve PCOS. Studies consistently show that even modest weight loss of 5-10% can restore ovulation, reduce androgens, and improve insulin sensitivity<sup>11</sup>.

However, I want to emphasize several important points. Not all women with PCOS are overweight. Lean PCOS is common and requires different management strategies. Weight loss is extremely difficult with untreated insulin resistance. Addressing the metabolic dysfunction often makes weight loss more achievable. Focusing solely on weight can be counterproductive. The goal should be health-promoting behaviors rather than a number on the scale. Disordered eating is common in PCOS, and aggressive dieting can worsen this. A sustainable, nourishing approach is essential.

## Targeted Supplementation

While diet and lifestyle form the foundation of PCOS management, certain supplements have evidence supporting their use. These should be individualized based on your specific presentation and needs.

### Inositol

Inositol, particularly myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, has become one of the most well-researched supplements for PCOS. These compounds are involved in insulin signaling, and women with PCOS often have altered inositol metabolism.

Research shows inositol supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce androgens, promote more regular ovulation, and support fertility<sup>12</sup>. A combination of myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol in a 40:1 ratio appears to be most effective, as this mimics the physiological ratio found in the body.

Typical dosing is 2-4 grams of myo-inositol daily, often combined with 50-100mg of D-chiro-inositol. Benefits typically emerge within 2-3 months of consistent use.

### Berberine

Berberine is a plant compound with remarkable insulin-sensitizing effects. Studies have found it comparable to metformin for improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic markers in PCOS<sup>13</sup>. I have written more extensively about [berberine's metabolic effects](/articles/berberine-natures-ozempic) in another article.

Berberine may reduce fasting glucose and insulin levels, improve lipid profiles, support weight management, and reduce androgen levels. Typical dosing is 500mg two to three times daily with meals. Berberine can interact with certain medications, so professional guidance is recommended.

### N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)

NAC is an antioxidant that also improves insulin sensitivity and reduces androgens. Studies have shown benefits for ovulation induction and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS<sup>14</sup>. NAC may be particularly helpful for women who cannot tolerate metformin or prefer a natural alternative.

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Fish oil supplementation reduces inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, and may help with the depression and anxiety that often accompany PCOS<sup>15</sup>. Aim for 2-3 grams of combined EPA and DHA daily from quality fish oil.

### Vitamin D

Vitamin D deficiency is common in women with PCOS and associated with worse metabolic and hormonal parameters<sup>16</sup>. Testing and correcting vitamin D status is a simple intervention that may improve insulin sensitivity and support regular ovulation.

### Magnesium

Magnesium is involved in glucose metabolism and is often depleted in insulin-resistant states. Supplementation may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. For more on [magnesium's benefits](/articles/magnesium-the-natural-muscle-relaxer), see my related article.

## When to Seek Additional Support

While natural approaches are effective for many women with PCOS, some situations warrant conventional medical intervention.

You should consult with your healthcare provider if you are trying to conceive and have not achieved pregnancy after 6-12 months of well-timed intercourse, if you have very irregular or absent periods that have not responded to lifestyle interventions, if you have signs of severe insulin resistance such as acanthosis nigricans (dark, velvety skin patches) or very high fasting insulin levels, if you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or disordered eating related to PCOS, or if you need assistance with acne or hirsutism that significantly affects your quality of life.

Conventional treatments including metformin, oral contraceptives, and fertility medications have their place and can be combined with natural approaches for optimal results.

## A Comprehensive Approach in Halifax

PCOS is complex, but it responds well to a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying metabolic dysfunction rather than just treating symptoms. Through careful assessment of your individual presentation, targeted dietary and lifestyle recommendations, appropriate supplementation, and ongoing support, significant improvement is possible for most women.
