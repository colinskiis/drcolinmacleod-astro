## An Adaptable Herb
Rhodiola is classified as an "adaptogen", which means that it is a herb which can assist the body in dealing with stress, help to maintain vitality and improve strength in general. For a broader overview of adaptogenic herbs including ashwagandha and others, see our guide to [adaptogens for stress management](/articles/adaptogens-for-stress-ashwagandha-rhodiola-and-beyond).

## How Rhodiola Works
Rhodiola has several active constituents, including rosavin and salidroside, among others, which are believed to give Rhodiola it’s [stress-fighting properties](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3751623)<sup>1</sup>. Rhodiola’s mechanism of action is suspected to be largely through neurotransmission, including serotonin, dopamine and adrenaline modulation<sup>2</sup>. My experience has been that this herb has a balancing effect on mood, energy, stress and can be a helpful adjunct to stress management techniques in people who are feeling the pinch of stress or exhaustion.

## Conditions Treated
There has been encouraging clinical research performed [on](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10839209) Rhodiola over the past two decades, including [trials](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22228617) [showing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19016404) [beneficial](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12725561) [effects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11081987) on [fatigue](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10763116)<sup>[3,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22228617)</sup><sup>[4,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19016404)</sup><sup>[5,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12725561)</sup><sup>[6,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11081987)</sup><sup>[7,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10839209)</sup><sup>[8,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10763116)</sup> [general well-being](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308973)<sup>9</sup>, [mild to moderate depression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17990195)<sup>10</sup>, [generalized anxiety disorder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18307390)<sup>11</sup>, [muscle damage during exercise](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308973)<sup>12</sup> and improved [endurance exercise performance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15256690)<sup>13</sup>. The available research has been quite supportive of the traditional uses of the herb and has even found some new clinical uses.

## Safety
There are no known major adverse effects of Rhodiola and the reported adverse effects, including dry mouth and dizziness, have been mild at [standard](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17990195) [doses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18307390)<sup>[10,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17990195)</sup><sup>[11](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18307390)</sup>. Rhodiola should be not be used during pregnancy due to a lack of safety data in pregnancy. As with all [herbal medicines](https://drcolinmacleod.com/herbal-medicine), interactions with medications are possible. Please consult with your naturopathic doctor before starting any new herbal treatment.
