## What Type of Training Do Naturopathic Doctors Have?
Naturopathic doctors have extensive training, including a pre-med degree and four years of full-time education from an accredited school of naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic training consists of over 1,200 hours of clinical experience and over 3,000 hours of classroom training.
Naturopathic medical science training includes anatomy, physiology, pathology, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, blood test interpretation, physical examination and more. Naturopathic training also includes clinical nutrition, lifestyle counseling, herbal medicine, acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine, homeopathy and more.
Naturopathic Doctors practicing in Nova Scotia are required to comply with yearly continuing education requirements of the Canadian and Nova Scotia Associations of Naturopathic Doctors.

## Is Homeopathy The Same As Naturopathic Medicine?
No. Homeopathy is a system of medicine which uses gentle, highly-diluted remedies to effectively address health issues. Homeopaths are trained solely in the use of homeopathy, whereas naturopathic doctors have training in a number of treatment methods, including homeopathy. A homeopath receives more training in homeopathy than a naturopathic doctor but naturopathic doctors are well equipped to use homeopathy.

## How Do I Pay For Visits To A Naturopathic Doctor?
Nova Scotia provincial healthcare does not cover appointments with a naturopathic doctor so you will have to pay out of pocket for appointments. However, most private health insurance plans do cover visits to a naturopathic doctor, so check with your provider for details.

## What Conditions Can Naturopathic Doctors Treat?
Naturopathic doctors can treat the same conditions as a family medical doctor, including chronic and acute health conditions. Some conditions which naturopathic doctors treat include, digestive issues, fatigue, skin conditions, migraines, diabetes, cancer, chronic infections, injuries, pain and many more. If your ND is unable to treat a specific condition they will refer appropriately.

## How Do I Confirm A Naturopathic Doctor’s Qualifications?
To ensure a naturopathic doctor's qualifications in Nova Scotia you can look for their name listed online at the websites of the [Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors](https://www.cand.ca/) and the [Nova Scotia Association of Naturopathic Doctors](https://nsand.ca/members). If you have questions regarding any practitioner's training, you should be upfront and ask them to clarify.
