## The Growing Burden of Respiratory Conditions

Asthma affects approximately 10% of Canadians, making it one of the most common chronic conditions<sup>1</sup>. Beyond asthma, millions more struggle with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), chronic sinusitis, and other respiratory concerns that affect their daily quality of life. In Nova Scotia, where seasonal changes bring shifting pollen counts, mold exposure, and indoor air quality challenges during long winters, respiratory concerns are particularly common in my Halifax practice.

For many people with asthma and respiratory conditions, conventional treatments provide good control. Inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators can be effective and, when needed, potentially lifesaving. However, some patients experience incomplete symptom control, medication side effects, or simply prefer to explore complementary approaches that address underlying factors.

Naturopathic medicine does not replace appropriate medical management of asthma. Asthma can be a serious, even life-threatening condition, and patients should maintain their rescue medications and follow their physician's guidance. What naturopathic approaches can offer is identification and reduction of triggers, support for the underlying inflammation driving symptoms, optimization of overall respiratory health, and potentially reduced reliance on medications in some cases.

## Understanding Asthma

### What Happens in Asthmatic Airways

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the airways. In people with asthma, the airways are persistently inflamed and hypersensitive. When triggered, they respond with bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways due to muscle spasm), increased mucus production, and swelling of the airway lining.

These responses cause the characteristic symptoms of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Symptoms may be intermittent or persistent, mild or severe, depending on the individual and their triggers.

Understanding that asthma is fundamentally an inflammatory condition explains why anti-inflammatory approaches, whether pharmaceutical (inhaled corticosteroids) or natural (dietary and supplemental), are central to management.

### Types of Asthma

Asthma is not a single condition but a spectrum with different underlying mechanisms.

**Allergic asthma** is triggered by allergens such as pollen, dust mites, mold, and animal dander. It often coexists with allergic rhinitis and eczema (the "atopic triad"). This type involves IgE-mediated immune responses and typically responds well to allergen avoidance and treatments targeting the allergic pathway.

**Non-allergic asthma** is triggered by factors other than allergens, including respiratory infections, cold air, exercise, irritants (smoke, strong odors), stress, and certain medications. The inflammatory mechanisms differ somewhat from allergic asthma.

**Exercise-induced asthma** (more accurately called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction) involves airway narrowing during or after exercise, particularly in cold, dry air. It can occur in people with or without underlying asthma.

**Occupational asthma** is caused or worsened by workplace exposures to chemicals, dust, or other substances.

Many people have mixed-type asthma with multiple triggers.

### The Role of Inflammation

Chronic airway inflammation is the defining feature of asthma. This inflammation involves multiple cell types including eosinophils, mast cells, T lymphocytes, and others, along with various inflammatory mediators. Even between attacks, when patients feel well, subclinical inflammation persists in asthmatic airways.

This understanding has shifted asthma treatment from purely symptom-based (bronchodilators for attacks) to controller-based (daily anti-inflammatory medications to prevent attacks). Natural approaches to asthma similarly focus on reducing this underlying inflammation.

## Identifying and Avoiding Triggers

Reducing exposure to triggers is foundational to asthma management. Common triggers include:

### Allergens

For allergic asthma, identifying and minimizing allergen exposure is crucial. Dust mites thrive in bedding, upholstered furniture, and carpeting. Strategies include encasing mattresses and pillows in allergen-proof covers, washing bedding weekly in hot water, reducing carpet and upholstered furniture, maintaining low humidity (dust mites need humidity), and considering air purifiers with HEPA filters.

Mold grows in damp environments. Address moisture problems promptly, use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens, clean visible mold with appropriate solutions, and consider a dehumidifier in damp areas.

Pet allergens from cats and dogs can trigger asthma. Ideally, allergic individuals should not have these pets, but if they do, keep pets out of bedrooms, use HEPA air purifiers, wash hands after contact, and consider regular pet bathing.

Pollen triggers seasonal exacerbations. Monitor pollen counts, keep windows closed during high-pollen seasons, shower and change clothes after outdoor activities, and consider starting anti-inflammatory support before your worst season.

### Irritants

Tobacco smoke is a major asthma trigger and general respiratory toxin. Smoking cessation is essential, and secondhand smoke exposure should be eliminated. Wood smoke from fireplaces and wood stoves can trigger asthma. Consider alternative heating or ensure excellent ventilation. Strong odors and chemicals including perfumes, cleaning products, air fresheners, and paint fumes can trigger symptoms. Choose fragrance-free products and ensure ventilation when using chemicals. Air pollution including outdoor pollution (traffic, industrial) and indoor pollution affects respiratory health. Monitor air quality and limit outdoor exertion on high-pollution days.

### Other Triggers

Respiratory infections, particularly viral infections, are common asthma triggers. Good hand hygiene, maintaining immune health, and staying current on vaccinations (including flu) help prevent infections. Cold air can trigger bronchoconstriction. Cover your nose and mouth with a scarf in cold weather and consider warming up gradually before outdoor winter exercise. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) can worsen asthma, possibly through micro-aspiration or neural reflexes. Treating reflux may improve asthma control in affected individuals. Stress and strong emotions can trigger asthma attacks. Stress management is part of comprehensive asthma care.

## Dietary Approaches to Respiratory Health

### Anti-Inflammatory Eating

Given that asthma is an inflammatory condition, an anti-inflammatory diet makes sense as a foundational approach. Research supports this: adherence to Mediterranean-style diets is associated with better asthma control and reduced symptoms<sup>2</sup>.

Anti-inflammatory foods to emphasize include fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel for omega-3 fatty acids. Colorful vegetables and fruits provide antioxidants and polyphenols. Olive oil contains oleocanthal with anti-inflammatory properties. Nuts, especially walnuts, provide omega-3s and antioxidants. Herbs and spices such as turmeric, ginger, and rosemary have anti-inflammatory compounds.

Pro-inflammatory foods to reduce include processed foods and refined sugars, excess omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils, trans fats, and excessive red and processed meats.

### Specific Nutrients for Respiratory Health

**Vitamin D** deficiency is associated with more severe asthma and poorer control<sup>3</sup>. Vitamin D has immune-modulating effects and may reduce airway inflammation. Many people in northern climates are deficient. Testing and optimizing vitamin D status is reasonable for anyone with asthma.

**Magnesium** relaxes smooth muscle, including bronchial smooth muscle. Low magnesium is associated with increased asthma severity. Intravenous magnesium is used in hospital settings for severe attacks. Dietary and supplemental magnesium may support respiratory function.

**Omega-3 fatty acids** reduce inflammatory mediator production. Some studies show improvements in asthma with fish oil supplementation, though results are mixed<sup>4</sup>. Given other benefits of omega-3s and their safety, they are reasonable to include.

**Antioxidants** including vitamins C and E, selenium, and various polyphenols may help counter oxidative stress in asthmatic airways. Eating a diet rich in colorful fruits and vegetables provides these naturally.

### Foods That May Worsen Asthma

For some individuals, certain foods trigger asthma symptoms. Sulfites are preservatives found in wine, dried fruits, and some processed foods that can trigger asthma in sensitive individuals. Salicylates are compounds found naturally in many foods and in aspirin that trigger asthma in some people. Specific food allergies can trigger asthma in those with food allergies, particularly to common allergens.

If you suspect food triggers, keeping a food and symptom diary or working with a healthcare provider on an elimination diet can help identify problem foods.

### Weight Management

Obesity is associated with more severe asthma and poorer response to medications. Excess body weight increases inflammatory mediators, impairs lung function mechanically, and affects the immune responses underlying asthma. Weight loss in overweight asthmatic individuals often improves symptoms and medication requirements<sup>5</sup>.

## Supplements for Respiratory Support

### Fish Oil

Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil reduce production of inflammatory leukotrienes and may help reduce airway inflammation. Study results are mixed, with some showing benefit and others showing no effect<sup>6</sup>. Given the overall health benefits of omega-3s and their safety, supplementation with 2-3 grams of EPA/DHA daily is reasonable for those with asthma.

### Vitamin D

For individuals with low vitamin D levels, supplementation may improve asthma control. A 2016 Cochrane review found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of severe asthma attacks requiring systemic corticosteroids<sup>7</sup>. Testing vitamin D levels and supplementing to achieve optimal levels (typically 75-125 nmol/L) is recommended.

### Magnesium

Oral magnesium supplementation may provide modest benefits for asthma. Magnesium glycinate or citrate at doses of 200-400mg daily is well-tolerated and may support bronchial relaxation.

### N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)

NAC is a precursor to glutathione, a key antioxidant in the lungs. It also has mucolytic properties, helping to thin mucus. Some research suggests benefits for respiratory conditions, though evidence specifically for asthma is limited<sup>8</sup>.

### Quercetin

Quercetin is a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antihistamine properties. It may help stabilize mast cells and reduce allergic responses. While human asthma trials are limited, its mechanisms support potential benefit for allergic asthma.

### Boswellia

Boswellia serrata extract inhibits 5-lipoxygenase, reducing production of inflammatory leukotrienes. Some studies show improvements in asthma symptoms with boswellia supplementation<sup>9</sup>.

### Probiotics

Given the connection between gut health and immune function, probiotics may influence allergic and respiratory conditions. Some studies show benefits for allergic rhinitis and possibly asthma, though evidence is still developing<sup>10</sup>.

## Herbal Approaches

Several herbs have traditional use for respiratory conditions, though evidence from clinical trials varies.

**Butterbur** (Petasites hybridus) has shown benefit for allergic rhinitis and may help with asthma. However, raw butterbur contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are toxic to the liver, so only certified PA-free extracts should be used.

**Ginkgo biloba** has anti-inflammatory properties and has been studied for asthma with some positive results.

**Tylophora indica** is used in traditional Indian medicine for asthma. Some studies show benefit, but quality evidence is limited.

**Dried ivy leaf** (Hedera helix) is approved in Europe for respiratory conditions and may help with coughs and bronchitis.

I recommend working with a knowledgeable practitioner before using herbal remedies for asthma, as interactions with medications are possible and quality control varies.

## Breathing Techniques

Learning proper breathing techniques can benefit people with asthma and other respiratory conditions.

### Buteyko Breathing

The Buteyko method emphasizes nasal breathing, reducing breathing volume, and breath-holding exercises. Some studies show improvements in asthma symptoms and reduced bronchodilator use with Buteyko training<sup>11</sup>. The method is safe and can be learned from trained practitioners or online resources.

### Diaphragmatic Breathing

Many people with asthma develop dysfunctional breathing patterns, using accessory muscles rather than the diaphragm. Relearning diaphragmatic (belly) breathing can improve respiratory efficiency and reduce the work of breathing.

### Yoga and Pranayama

Yoga, including its breathing practices (pranayama), may benefit people with asthma through stress reduction, improved breathing patterns, and possibly direct effects on lung function. Multiple studies show improvements in quality of life and some measures of lung function with regular yoga practice<sup>12</sup>.

## Environmental Modifications

### Indoor Air Quality

Since we spend most of our time indoors, indoor air quality significantly affects respiratory health. Use HEPA air purifiers in bedrooms and main living areas. Maintain appropriate humidity (30-50%); too dry irritates airways, too humid promotes mold and dust mites. Ensure adequate ventilation. Avoid or ventilate when using volatile chemicals (cleaning products, paint, etc.). Consider houseplants that improve air quality, though avoid overwatering which promotes mold. Replace air filters regularly in HVAC systems.

### Reduce Chemical Exposures

Choose fragrance-free cleaning and personal care products. Avoid aerosol sprays when possible. Use low-VOC paints and building materials. Consider natural alternatives for household cleaning.

## Managing Related Conditions

### Allergic Rhinitis

Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) commonly coexists with asthma. Poor control of nasal allergies can worsen asthma through inflammatory connections and mouth breathing (bypassing the nose's filtering and humidifying functions). Effectively managing nasal symptoms often improves asthma control.

Natural approaches to allergic rhinitis include nasal saline rinses (neti pot or squeeze bottle), quercetin supplementation, stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), butterbur extract, and local honey (though evidence is limited).

### Gastroesophageal Reflux

GERD is common in people with asthma and can worsen respiratory symptoms. Reflux management includes not eating close to bedtime, elevating the head of the bed, avoiding trigger foods (spicy, acidic, fatty), maintaining healthy weight, and considering herbs like licorice (DGL) or supplements that support digestive function.

### Sinusitis

Chronic sinusitis often accompanies asthma. Addressing sinus infections and inflammation with nasal rinses, appropriate treatment of infections, and reducing allergen exposure can improve overall respiratory health.

## Stress and Emotional Factors

Stress can trigger asthma attacks and worsen overall control. Stress management is not optional for comprehensive asthma care. Effective approaches include regular exercise (appropriate for your asthma control), mindfulness meditation, adequate sleep, cognitive-behavioral approaches, and addressing sources of chronic stress.

The anxiety that often accompanies asthma (understandably, given the frightening nature of breathing difficulties) can itself worsen symptoms. Breaking this cycle is important.

## When Natural Approaches Are Not Enough

Natural approaches to asthma work best as complements to appropriate medical care, not replacements. Seek medical care promptly if your asthma is not well-controlled despite treatment, if you are using your rescue inhaler more than twice a week (not including pre-exercise use), if you have had emergency room visits or hospitalizations for asthma, if you wake at night with asthma symptoms, or if asthma limits your activities.

Severe or poorly controlled asthma requires medical management. Natural approaches can then be added to support overall respiratory health and potentially reduce medication requirements over time, in consultation with your physician.

## Comprehensive Respiratory Care in Halifax

Respiratory health is influenced by multiple factors including allergens, irritants, diet, stress, and overall inflammation. A comprehensive approach addresses these underlying factors while supporting optimal lung function.

For patients with well-controlled asthma seeking to reduce triggers and support respiratory health naturally, or those with suboptimal control looking for complementary approaches, naturopathic medicine offers evidence-based options. These approaches work alongside conventional care, not in place of it.
