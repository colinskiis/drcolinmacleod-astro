## The Growing Metabolic Health Crisis

Type 2 diabetes has become one of the most significant health challenges facing Canadians today. According to Diabetes Canada, approximately 11 million Canadians are living with diabetes or prediabetes, and this number continues to climb<sup>1</sup>. Here in Halifax and throughout Nova Scotia, we see similar trends, with rates of diabetes and prediabetes rising steadily over the past several decades.

What makes this particularly concerning is that type 2 diabetes is largely preventable. Research consistently shows that lifestyle modifications can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58% or more in those with prediabetes<sup>2</sup>. The progression from healthy blood sugar to prediabetes to full diabetes typically occurs over years, providing a substantial window for intervention. Understanding how blood sugar regulation works and what disrupts it empowers people to take meaningful steps toward metabolic health.

## Understanding Blood Sugar Regulation

To appreciate what goes wrong in diabetes, it helps to understand how the body normally manages blood sugar. When you eat foods containing carbohydrates, your digestive system breaks them down into glucose, which enters your bloodstream. This rise in blood glucose signals your pancreas to release insulin, a hormone that acts like a key, unlocking cells throughout your body so they can absorb glucose for energy or storage.

In healthy metabolism, this system works seamlessly. Blood sugar rises modestly after meals, insulin facilitates glucose uptake into cells, and blood sugar returns to baseline within a few hours. The liver also plays a critical role, storing glucose as glycogen and releasing it between meals to maintain stable blood sugar levels.

Insulin sensitivity refers to how responsive your cells are to insulin's signal. When cells are highly sensitive to insulin, only small amounts are needed to effectively move glucose out of the bloodstream. This represents optimal metabolic function. Your muscles efficiently take up glucose for energy, your liver appropriately stores and releases glucose, and your pancreas produces just enough insulin to maintain balance.

## The Progression to Insulin Resistance and Diabetes

Metabolic problems begin when cells become less responsive to insulin, a condition called insulin resistance. In this state, the pancreas must produce increasingly larger amounts of insulin to achieve the same glucose-lowering effect. For a time, the pancreas compensates by ramping up insulin production, and blood sugar levels may remain in the normal range despite underlying dysfunction.

This compensatory phase can persist for years. However, chronically elevated insulin levels cause problems of their own, promoting fat storage (particularly around the abdomen), increasing inflammation, and contributing to cardiovascular risk. Eventually, the pancreas may struggle to keep up with demand, and blood sugar levels begin to rise.

Prediabetes represents this intermediate stage where blood sugar is higher than normal but not yet in the diabetic range. According to the American Diabetes Association, fasting blood glucose between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L or HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4% indicates prediabetes<sup>3</sup>. Many people with prediabetes have no symptoms and remain unaware of their metabolic risk.

Without intervention, roughly 5-10% of people with prediabetes progress to type 2 diabetes each year<sup>4</sup>. Over time, consistently elevated blood sugar damages blood vessels and nerves throughout the body, leading to the serious complications associated with diabetes including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, vision problems, and neuropathy.

## Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes

Understanding risk factors helps identify who might benefit most from proactive prevention strategies. Some factors cannot be changed, while others are modifiable through lifestyle choices.

Family history significantly influences diabetes risk. Having a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes increases your risk substantially. Certain ethnic backgrounds, including Indigenous peoples, South Asian, African, and Hispanic populations, also carry higher risk<sup>5</sup>. Age plays a role as well, with risk increasing after age 45, though type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in younger people.

Among modifiable risk factors, excess weight, particularly when carried around the abdomen, strongly predicts diabetes risk. A waist circumference greater than 102 cm (40 inches) in men or 88 cm (35 inches) in women indicates increased metabolic risk. Physical inactivity, poor dietary patterns, and inadequate sleep all contribute to insulin resistance. A history of gestational diabetes during pregnancy also signals increased future risk.

Interestingly, research has revealed connections between diabetes risk and factors like the gut microbiome, chronic stress, and environmental exposures. This complexity underscores why prevention strategies should address multiple aspects of health rather than focusing narrowly on any single factor.

## The Central Role of Diet in Blood Sugar Balance

What you eat profoundly affects blood sugar regulation. The type, amount, and combination of foods all influence how dramatically blood sugar rises after eating and how effectively insulin works over time.

The glycemic index (GI) measures how quickly different foods raise blood sugar compared to pure glucose. High-GI foods cause rapid blood sugar spikes, while low-GI foods produce more gradual rises. However, the glycemic index tells only part of the story. Glycemic load considers both the quality of carbohydrates (GI) and the quantity consumed, providing a more complete picture of a food's impact on blood sugar.

Beyond these metrics, meal composition matters tremendously. Combining carbohydrates with protein, fat, and fiber dramatically slows glucose absorption and reduces blood sugar spikes. A piece of white bread eaten alone produces a very different metabolic response than the same bread consumed with eggs, vegetables, and olive oil. This principle explains why whole foods generally support better blood sugar control than processed foods, which often lack the protein, fat, and fiber that moderate glucose absorption.

Fiber deserves particular attention for blood sugar management. Soluble fiber forms a gel in the digestive tract, physically slowing the absorption of glucose. Research consistently shows that higher fiber intake improves insulin sensitivity and reduces diabetes risk<sup>6</sup>. Legumes, vegetables, whole grains, and fruits with their skins provide meaningful fiber, while processed foods typically contain little. Most Canadians consume far less fiber than recommended, representing a significant missed opportunity for metabolic health support.

The pattern of eating also influences blood sugar regulation. Frequent snacking, particularly on refined carbohydrates, keeps blood sugar and insulin levels elevated throughout the day. Some research suggests that time-restricted eating, where food intake is confined to a consistent window of time each day, may improve insulin sensitivity, though individual responses vary and this approach is not appropriate for everyone<sup>7</sup>.

Rather than focusing on any single dietary rule, the overall pattern matters most. Diets emphasizing vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, fish, and olive oil consistently demonstrate benefits for blood sugar control and diabetes prevention. The Mediterranean diet, in particular, has shown significant reductions in diabetes risk in multiple large studies<sup>8</sup>.

## Physical Activity and Insulin Sensitivity

Exercise is one of the most powerful tools for improving insulin sensitivity. During physical activity, muscles can take up glucose without requiring insulin, providing immediate blood sugar-lowering effects. Regular exercise also improves insulin sensitivity for hours to days afterward, enhancing the body's ability to regulate blood sugar even at rest.

Both aerobic exercise and resistance training offer metabolic benefits, though through somewhat different mechanisms. Aerobic activity improves cardiovascular fitness and helps with weight management. Resistance training builds muscle mass, and since muscle is a primary site of glucose uptake, having more muscle provides greater "storage capacity" for blood sugar. Research suggests combining both types of exercise provides the greatest benefits for metabolic health<sup>9</sup>.

The encouraging news is that meaningful benefits occur with moderate, achievable activity levels. Walking regularly, taking the stairs, gardening, and other everyday movements contribute to metabolic health. You don't need to become an athlete. Consistency matters more than intensity, and any activity is better than none.

Prolonged sitting, independent of exercise habits, appears to negatively affect insulin sensitivity. Breaking up long periods of sitting with brief movement, even just a few minutes of walking, helps maintain better blood sugar control throughout the day. For those with desk jobs, standing periodically, walking during phone calls, or taking short movement breaks can make a meaningful difference.

## Sleep, Stress, and Metabolic Health

Sleep quality and duration significantly influence blood sugar regulation, a connection that often surprises people. Research shows that even short-term sleep restriction impairs insulin sensitivity and increases appetite, particularly for high-carbohydrate foods<sup>10</sup>. Chronic sleep deprivation creates a metabolic environment that promotes both weight gain and insulin resistance.

The relationship between sleep and blood sugar works in both directions. Poor blood sugar control can disrupt sleep, and poor sleep worsens blood sugar control, creating a potentially vicious cycle. Prioritizing consistent, adequate sleep provides foundational support for metabolic health.

Chronic stress similarly affects blood sugar through multiple pathways. Stress hormones like cortisol directly raise blood sugar and promote insulin resistance. Stress also tends to disrupt healthy eating and exercise habits, compounding its metabolic effects. Many people reach for high-sugar, high-fat comfort foods when stressed, creating additional blood sugar challenges.

Effective stress management looks different for everyone, but research supports various approaches including regular physical activity, adequate sleep, social connection, time in nature, and mind-body practices like meditation or yoga. Identifying and addressing major life stressors, rather than simply coping with chronic overwhelm, represents perhaps the most fundamental approach to stress-related health problems.

## The Importance of Early Detection

Because prediabetes typically causes no symptoms, many people remain unaware of their metabolic risk until significant problems develop. Routine screening allows early identification when intervention is most effective.

Standard screening tests include fasting blood glucose, which measures blood sugar after an overnight fast, and HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), which reflects average blood sugar over the previous two to three months. Oral glucose tolerance testing, where blood sugar is measured before and after consuming a glucose drink, provides additional information about how the body handles a glucose challenge.

I find that comprehensive metabolic testing often reveals important information beyond basic glucose and HbA1c. Fasting insulin levels, while not routinely measured in conventional screening, can detect hyperinsulinemia (elevated insulin) that may precede blood sugar abnormalities by years. This early marker of insulin resistance provides an earlier warning and more time for intervention.

Advanced lipid testing often shows characteristic patterns in metabolic dysfunction, including elevated triglycerides and small, dense LDL particles that are more strongly associated with cardiovascular risk. Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein may also be elevated. Through our [lab testing services](/lab-testing), we can evaluate these and other markers to build a comprehensive picture of metabolic health.

For those with known prediabetes or diabetes, regular monitoring helps track progress and guide treatment decisions. Home glucose monitoring, continuous glucose monitors, and periodic lab testing all have roles depending on individual circumstances and treatment goals.

## Natural Compounds and Metabolic Support

Research continues to explore how various natural compounds affect blood sugar regulation. I've written previously about [berberine, which has received attention for its effects on blood sugar and metabolic health](/articles/berberine-natures-ozempic). This research into plant compounds illustrates both the potential and limitations of natural approaches, showing meaningful effects in studies while also highlighting that such compounds work best as part of comprehensive lifestyle strategies rather than as standalone interventions.

Various nutrients play roles in blood sugar regulation. Chromium participates in insulin signaling, and some research suggests supplementation may benefit those with deficiency. Magnesium is involved in hundreds of enzymatic reactions including those related to glucose metabolism, and inadequate magnesium status is associated with increased diabetes risk<sup>11</sup>. Alpha-lipoic acid, bitter melon, and cinnamon have all been studied for potential blood sugar effects, with varying levels of evidence.

The naturopathic approach emphasizes identifying and addressing individual needs rather than applying a standard protocol to everyone. What someone needs depends on their current metabolic status, dietary patterns, lifestyle factors, and other health considerations. Through [clinical nutrition consultations](/clinical-nutrition), we can assess individual factors and develop targeted recommendations.

It bears emphasizing that natural approaches complement rather than replace foundational lifestyle changes. No supplement can compensate for a poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, inadequate sleep, or chronic stress. The research on diabetes prevention is clear that comprehensive lifestyle modification remains the most powerful intervention available<sup>2</sup>.

## The Naturopathic Approach to Metabolic Health

Naturopathic medicine brings a distinct perspective to diabetes prevention and blood sugar balance. Rather than waiting for disease to develop and then managing symptoms, the emphasis falls on identifying and addressing the factors driving metabolic dysfunction before irreversible changes occur.

This approach begins with thorough assessment. Understanding someone's complete health history, current symptoms, dietary patterns, activity level, sleep quality, stress factors, and relevant family history provides essential context. Laboratory testing adds objective data about current metabolic function and helps identify areas requiring attention.

Treatment plans are individualized and typically address multiple factors simultaneously. Dietary recommendations are tailored to individual preferences, cultural background, and practical constraints rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach. Exercise recommendations consider current fitness level, physical limitations, and what someone will realistically maintain long-term. Stress management and sleep optimization receive attention when relevant, recognizing that these factors significantly influence metabolic health.

The goal is sustainable lifestyle change rather than short-term fixes. Crash diets and extreme exercise programs rarely produce lasting results. Gradual, progressive changes that become integrated into daily life offer the best chance of long-term success. Patient education helps people understand why recommendations matter and how their choices affect their metabolic health, supporting informed decision-making and intrinsic motivation.

## Working Alongside Conventional Care

Naturopathic care for diabetes prevention and metabolic health works best as part of an integrated approach. For those with prediabetes, lifestyle interventions represent the first-line recommendation in conventional guidelines as well, making naturopathic and conventional approaches highly complementary.

For those already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, coordination with the primary care team is essential. Diabetes medications can be lifesaving, and decisions about medication use should involve the prescribing physician. Natural approaches can often help improve metabolic function and may reduce medication requirements over time, but any changes to diabetes medications require careful medical supervision due to the risk of hypoglycemia (dangerously low blood sugar).

Here in Halifax, I work collaboratively with family physicians and specialists when managing patients with diabetes or prediabetes. This collaborative approach ensures that patients receive the benefits of both conventional monitoring and treatment and naturopathic lifestyle and nutritional support. Open communication between providers serves patient safety and optimal outcomes.

## Taking Action for Metabolic Health

Whether you have known prediabetes, risk factors for diabetes, or simply want to optimize your metabolic health, meaningful steps are available. The research supporting lifestyle intervention for diabetes prevention is remarkably strong, with effects rivaling or exceeding those of medications in many studies<sup>2</sup>.

Start where you are. You don't need to overhaul your entire life overnight. Identify one or two changes that feel achievable and focus on making those consistent before adding more. Perhaps that means adding vegetables to each meal, taking a daily walk, or establishing a consistent sleep schedule. Small changes, maintained over time, create substantial results.

Pay attention to how you feel. Beyond lab numbers, notice your energy levels, mental clarity, mood, and how you feel after eating different foods. These subjective indicators often provide valuable feedback about what works for your body.

Seek appropriate testing and guidance. Understanding your current metabolic status through proper testing allows targeted interventions and provides a baseline for measuring progress. Working with healthcare providers who understand metabolic health can help you navigate the sometimes confusing landscape of nutrition and lifestyle recommendations.

If you're concerned about your blood sugar, have risk factors for diabetes, or want to take a proactive approach to metabolic health, I invite you to schedule a consultation with Dr. Colin MacLeod ND. Together we can assess your individual situation, identify the factors most relevant to your metabolic health, and develop a practical plan that fits your life. Prevention is always preferable to treatment, and when it comes to type 2 diabetes, we have powerful tools for prevention that deserve to be used.
