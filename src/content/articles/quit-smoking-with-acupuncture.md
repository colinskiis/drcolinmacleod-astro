Smoking has a major impact on our population. In Canada, 17% of adults smoke regularly<sup>1</sup> and 16.6% of people die due to smoking-related causes<sup>2</sup>. The leading smoking-induced causes of death in Canada are cancer (47%), cardiovascular disease (28%) and respiratory diseases (22%)<sup>2</sup>.

## Acupuncture & Smoking

Acupuncture has been used for over two thousand years in Traditional Chinese Medicine to support health and treat many health conditions. Within the past 50 years acupuncture has become a popular treatment method all over the world, including in the treatment of nicotine addiction.

Acupuncture as a treatment for smoking and addictions has been extensively studied over the past few decades. Many studies have shown positive effects, including reduced cravings and improved cessation rates<sup>3</sup>. Other studies have found acupuncture to be quite helpful in treatment of addictions in general, including in treating concurrent substance use and anxiety<sup>4</sup>. In my practice I have seen very encouraging results with acupuncture for quitting smoking and managing withdrawal. It is an essential part of my practice for helping patients, even those with a long history of smoking, to reduce and even quit.

## Respiratory Conditions

Compounds within cigarette smoke have been shown to directly cause lung cancer<sup>5</sup> and smoking has also been shown to be the direct cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<sup>6</sup>. Regular cigarette smoking also damages the airways and lung tissue, leading to respiratory conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

## Cardiovascular Disease

Cigarette smoking also contributes significantly to the build-up of plaques within the blood vessels. These plaque deposits lead to atherosclerosis and increase risk of heart attack and stroke<sup>7</sup>. It has been estimated that smoking doubles the risk of stroke<sup>8</sup>. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.

A review of smoking research by the U.S. Surgeon General<sup>9</sup> concluded that "smoking harms nearly every organ of the body, causing many diseases and reduces the health of smokers in general." Also, "quitting smoking has immediate as well as long-term benefits."

## Conventional Treatments

As far as conventional treatment for quitting smoking goes, nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum)<sup>10</sup>, varenicline (Champix) and buproprion (Zyban) all help to reduce craving and promote abstinence, though each has possible side effects. Champix can cause gastrointestinal side effects<sup>11</sup> and research has shown that it may increase cardiovascular risk<sup>12</sup>. Nicotine gum or patches are generally quite safe but should not be used during pregnancy due to an increased risk of congenital malformations<sup>13</sup>. Zyban which is also used as an anti-depressant is another safe treatment with more mild side effects of insomnia, dry mouth and nausea.
