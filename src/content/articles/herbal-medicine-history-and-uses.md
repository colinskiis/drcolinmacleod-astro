Plants have evolved over millions of years, developing chemical compounds which aide them in fending off bacteria, fungi and grazing animals. When consumed by humans, these chemically unique compounds can affect a variety of processes within our bodies. Many of the compounds created by different herbs are similar in structure and function to compounds which are essential to human physiology. As a result these herbal constituents can have profound physiological effects on the human body. This concept is not surprising if we consider that animals and humans have mutually co-evolved over millions of years<sup>1</sup>.

## History

Herbal medicine is an ancient system of medicine which has been used by many civilizations throughout history. Ancient Egyptian medical papyri<sup>2</sup> dating back to the 17th and 16th centuries BC contained detailed information regarding anatomy, physiology and specific health conditions with corresponding herbal treatments. The oldest recovered Chinese herbal text, Huang Di Nei Jing (Yellow Emperor Classic), is dated between 500 BC – 200 AD. It details much of the fundamental principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, including herbal medicines<sup>3</sup>. Also, the earliest known Indian (Ayurvedic) herbal medicine texts are dated between 500 BC – 500 AD<sup>4</sup>. In Europe herbal medicine gained popularity in the 1500-1600s, with many authors publishing detailed accounts<sup>5</sup> of the medicinal uses of herbs.

## Drugs From Plants

Many important, widely used, drugs have been isolated and/or modified from plant sources. An extract from the Pacific Yew tree is the starting material of a first line chemotherapy drug used in many types of cancer, Taxol (paclitaxel)<sup>6</sup>. Also, the White Willow tree is the starting material for one of the most commonly used drugs in the world, Aspirin<sup>7</sup>. Interestingly, White Willow was reportedly used by several ancient doctors, including Hippocrates<sup>8</sup>, for rheumatic pain. These two drugs, along with a large list of others, have been derived from plant sources.

## Uses

Traditional herbal medicine was used to treat a wide variety of conditions, including pain, arthritis, weight loss, anxiety, depression, etc. Most modern day herbal research is based on testing traditional herbal uses and generally the research backs it up. Milk thistle (Silymarin)<sup>9</sup>, for example, has traditionally been used as a liver-tonic and research has recently shown it to improve outcomes in chronic liver disease. Traditional treatments for migraines (Feverfew)<sup>10</sup>, anxiety (Kava)<sup>11</sup>, menstrual irregularities (Chaste tree)<sup>12</sup> and the common cold (Andrographis)<sup>13</sup>, among many others, have also been supported by modern research. An interesting area of new herbal research is in finding new medicines, including natural cancer treatments such as mistletoe<sup>14</sup>.

Herbal medicine has many valid and useful applications, which when properly applied, can have profound results. Herbal medicine has been used for thousands of years across many civilizations and has more recently seen significant modern scientific validation. Due to the complex nature of herbal medicine and potential for interactions with medications it is best to consult with a practitioner trained in the proper use of herbs who can work with you to design an optimal treatment plan.
