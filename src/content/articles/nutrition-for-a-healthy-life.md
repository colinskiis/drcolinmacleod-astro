The famous quote from Hippocrates, "Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food", stressed the importance of proper nutrition in maintaining health. His wisdom rings as true today as it did in his time. Most of the health issues that face present day North Americans are caused by a handful of lifestyle factors, namely eating poorly and not exercising enough. Being overweight leads to a myriad of negative health effects, such as cardiovascular disease<sup>1</sup> and type 2 diabetes<sup>2</sup>. This is a serious problem, considering that over half of Canadian adults are overweight or obese<sup>3</sup>. A simple measurement of waist circumference<sup>4</sup> has been shown to be a good predictor of long-term health.

With busy lifestyles that center on work, food is often treated simply as a means to an end. The first and most important step towards a good diet is being aware of what you are eating and knowing what foods are good for you and which are not.

## Fruit And Vegetables

The standard North American diet is low in fruit and vegetables and as a result leads to a range of negative health effects. Many studies have associated fruit and vegetable intake with reduced risk of heart disease<sup>5,6</sup>, type 2 diabetes<sup>7</sup>, stroke<sup>8</sup> and cancer<sup>9</sup>. It may seem like simply good sense to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables but most people are below the recommended 5-10 servings per day. It's been estimated that deaths due to not eating enough fruit and vegetables have reached 2.6 million per year worldwide. Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption to 5-10 servings per day could significantly reduce heart disease, stroke and cancer-related deaths. Diets higher in fruit and vegetables are also associated with general improved health and wellbeing<sup>10</sup>. Salads with berries, steamed vegetables, or sliced fruit/vegetables as a snack are a few great ways to get in your 5-10 servings.

## Fat

Although fat was considered unhealthy<sup>11</sup> in the past, we now know that it is an important part of the diet and which fats we choose is important. Ideal fat sources include extra virgin cold pressed olive oil<sup>12</sup>, fatty fish<sup>13</sup>, coconut oil, avocado and flax seed oil. Unhealthy fat sources include margarine<sup>14</sup>, canola oil, corn oil, peanut oil and vegetable oils high in omega-6<sup>15</sup>. Ideally olive oil and fatty fish should supply the majority of the diet's fat.

## Carbohydrates

Over-consumption of refined carbohydrates, more specifically sugar-sweetened beverages<sup>16</sup>, is one of the biggest problems in the standard North American diet. Whole grains such as whole wheat and brown rice are ideal sources of carbohydrate as they naturally contain fibre. Fibre has many health benefits besides keeping you regular, such as aiding in weight loss, lowering cholesterol and lowering blood pressure. Much of the beneficial effects of fibre are likely due to its ability to control blood sugar levels. Healthy sources include whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat breads, pastas and corn. Poor sources of carbohydrates include refined grains, such as white bread, white rice, white sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, fructose, glucose, sucrose and potatoes.

## Protein

Protein is an essential component of any diet, as it is an integral component of every tissue in our bodies. Besides providing amino acid building blocks for protein synthesis, protein is also converted into sugar in a slow, controlled manner by the body. Eating high quality protein has been associated with having less abdominal fat<sup>17</sup> and improved body composition<sup>18</sup>. Good protein sources include fish, chicken, turkey, nuts, legumes and occasionally red meats. Unhealthy sources include processed meats<sup>19</sup>, such as hot dogs, bacon and processed lunch meats.

## Water

Last, and certainly not least, is water. Though it is has no calories or vitamins, it is a very simple molecule which is involved in every process in our bodies and helps to maintain healthy blood sugar<sup>20</sup>. Keep a water bottle on hand, it helps to get in the 6-8 glasses per day we need to stay hydrated.

## A Balanced Diet

The ideal diet has been summed up nicely by the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate<sup>21</sup>. In short, half of your plate should be vegetables and fruit, one quarter of your plate should be whole grains and one quarter of your plate should be a healthy protein source. Water is the ideal beverage but tea is okay, avoid milk. They also recommend olive oil or canola oil, but I recommend sticking with olive oil. Portion sizes are the last piece of the puzzle. We must eat enough food to maintain a healthy weight, but no more. Over-eating is the ultimate cause of weight gain so self-control must be used to limit portion sizes.
