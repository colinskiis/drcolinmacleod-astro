## Understanding Immune Function

The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend against pathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. A well-functioning immune system not only fights infections but also identifies and eliminates abnormal cells before they can cause harm. While genetics play a role in immune function, lifestyle factors and nutritional status have profound effects on how well the immune system performs<sup>1</sup>.

## Nutritional Factors in Immunity

Certain nutrients are critical for proper immune function. Vitamin D, often called the "sunshine vitamin," is required for the activation of T-cells and macrophages and helps regulate inflammatory responses<sup>2</sup>. Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in Canada, especially during winter months when sun exposure is limited. Blood testing can determine vitamin D status, and supplementation may be recommended to achieve optimal levels.

Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that supports the production and function of white blood cells and protects immune cells from oxidative damage<sup>3</sup>. While dietary vitamin C is important, therapeutic doses through intravenous administration can achieve blood levels 50-100 times higher than oral supplementation, providing enhanced immune support in certain clinical situations.

Zinc is essential for immune cell development and function and is required for the development and activation of T-lymphocytes<sup>4</sup>. Deficiency impairs immune function and increases infection susceptibility. Other important nutrients for immune health include selenium, vitamin A, and the B vitamins.

## Lifestyle Factors Affecting Immunity

Sleep deprivation significantly impairs immune function by reducing the production of protective cytokines and decreasing antibody response<sup>5</sup>. Most adults require 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly to maintain optimal immune function.

Chronic stress suppresses immune function through elevated cortisol, which reduces lymphocyte production and impairs communication between immune cells<sup>6</sup>. Stress-reduction practices such as meditation, deep breathing, and regular exercise support immune resilience.

Moderate regular exercise enhances immunity by promoting good circulation of immune cells and reducing chronic inflammation<sup>7</sup>. However, overtraining without adequate recovery can actually suppress immune function, which is an important consideration for athletes.

A whole-foods diet rich in colorful vegetables and fruits, quality proteins, and healthy fats provides the nutrients necessary for optimal immune function. Refined sugars, excessive alcohol, and processed foods can impair white blood cell function and promote inflammation.

## IV Therapy for Immune Support

Intravenous nutrient therapy allows for therapeutic doses that cannot be achieved through oral supplementation. The Myers' Cocktail, which includes B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium, and calcium, can replenish nutrient stores and support energy production needed for immune function. High-dose intravenous vitamin C achieves blood levels with direct antimicrobial activity and may be particularly beneficial for those with compromised immune systems or during acute illness.

## Herbal Medicine and Immunity

Botanical medicines have been used for centuries to support immune function, and modern research continues to validate their effectiveness<sup>8</sup>. Although there are several herbal medicines which are helpful in supporting immune health, it is best to consult a naturopathic doctor to have an individualized plan and to avoid any possible interactions with medications or contraindications.

## When to Seek Naturopathic Immune Support

If you experience frequent colds or infections, infections that linger or are difficult to resolve, chronic fatigue, or slow wound healing, a naturopathic assessment may be beneficial. Your naturopathic doctor can assess immune function through detailed health history, nutrient testing including vitamin D levels, and evaluation of lifestyle factors affecting immunity.
