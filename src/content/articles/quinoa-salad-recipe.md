## As Part Of A Meal

Quinoa salad can be eaten on its own as a vegetarian option or with a small serving of chicken for the omnivores out there. Chick peas are a good vegetarian source of protein which can be added to the salad in place of chicken. Considering that all of the ingredients in this salad are quite healthy, including the quinoa, vegetables and olive oil, it is good recipe to work into your diet on a regular basis. This is also a gluten-free option for people with problems with gluten.
