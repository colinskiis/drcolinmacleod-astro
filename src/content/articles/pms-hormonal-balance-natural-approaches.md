## Understanding Premenstrual Syndrome

Premenstrual syndrome affects a significant portion of menstruating women, yet it remains one of the most misunderstood and frequently dismissed health concerns. Up to 90% of women experience some premenstrual symptoms during their reproductive years, with approximately 20-40% reporting symptoms severe enough to affect their daily lives<sup>1</sup>. For some women, symptoms are merely an inconvenience signaling the approach of menstruation. For others, the week or two before their period brings significant physical discomfort, emotional upheaval, and disruption to work, relationships, and quality of life.

In my naturopathic practice in Halifax, Nova Scotia, I work with many women who have been told that PMS is simply something they must endure, that it is a normal part of being a woman, or that their only options are birth control pills or antidepressants. While these conventional approaches can certainly help some women, they do not address the underlying hormonal imbalances, nutritional deficiencies, and lifestyle factors that often drive premenstrual symptoms. A naturopathic approach seeks to understand why symptoms occur and to support the body in achieving better hormonal balance throughout the entire cycle.

## The Spectrum of Premenstrual Conditions

Premenstrual symptoms exist on a spectrum. Mild symptoms that do not significantly impair function are common and may not require intervention beyond basic self-care. Premenstrual syndrome involves a collection of physical, emotional, and behavioural symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, the time between ovulation and menstruation, and resolve within a few days of the period starting. Common PMS symptoms include breast tenderness and swelling, bloating and fluid retention, headaches or migraines, fatigue, food cravings, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating.

At the more severe end of the spectrum is premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which affects approximately 3-8% of menstruating women<sup>2</sup>. PMDD is characterized by severe mood symptoms including depression, anxiety, irritability, and emotional sensitivity that significantly impair daily functioning. The criteria for PMDD require that symptoms are severe enough to interfere with work, school, usual activities, or relationships. PMDD is a recognized psychiatric condition that often requires more intensive intervention, though the naturopathic approaches discussed here can still play a supportive role alongside appropriate medical care.

## The Hormonal Dance of the Menstrual Cycle

To understand PMS, we must first understand the normal hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. The average cycle lasts approximately 28 days, though anywhere from 21 to 35 days is considered normal. The cycle is divided into two main phases with ovulation marking the transition between them.

The follicular phase begins on the first day of menstruation and continues until ovulation. During this time, follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland stimulates the development of follicles in the ovaries, each containing an egg. As one follicle becomes dominant, it produces increasing amounts of estrogen. Estrogen rises throughout this phase, thickening the uterine lining and eventually triggering a surge of luteinizing hormone that causes ovulation. Many women feel their best during the follicular phase, particularly in the days following menstruation when estrogen is rising but not yet at its peak.

Ovulation occurs around day 14 in a typical cycle, though this varies considerably between women and even between cycles in the same woman. The release of the egg from the ovary transforms the remaining follicle into the corpus luteum, a temporary hormone-producing structure.

The luteal phase follows ovulation and continues until menstruation begins. During this phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone as well as some estrogen. Progesterone is the dominant hormone of this phase, preparing the uterine lining for potential implantation and sending signals throughout the body that pregnancy may be imminent. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, hormone levels fall sharply, and menstruation begins.

It is during this luteal phase that PMS symptoms occur. The characteristic timing of symptoms, appearing after ovulation and resolving with menstruation, is actually one of the diagnostic criteria for PMS. Symptoms that occur at other times of the cycle suggest other issues rather than true premenstrual syndrome.

## Why Some Women Experience More Severe Symptoms

Given that all menstruating women experience these same hormonal fluctuations, why do some develop significant PMS while others sail through their cycles without difficulty? The answer appears to lie not in the hormones themselves but in how individual women respond to normal hormonal changes.

Research suggests that women with PMS have an abnormal sensitivity to normal hormone fluctuations rather than abnormal hormone levels<sup>3</sup>. Studies have found that women with PMS and those without have similar hormone levels, yet their bodies respond differently to those hormones. This sensitivity may involve altered neurotransmitter responses to hormonal changes, differences in how hormones are metabolized, variations in receptor sensitivity, and individual differences in stress response systems.

That said, true hormonal imbalances can certainly worsen premenstrual symptoms. A common pattern I see in practice is estrogen dominance, a state where estrogen is elevated relative to progesterone. This can occur because estrogen production is genuinely elevated, because progesterone production is insufficient, or because estrogen is not being properly metabolized and eliminated. Estrogen dominance can intensify breast tenderness, fluid retention, mood symptoms, and heavy menstrual bleeding.

Other factors that influence PMS severity include nutritional status, as deficiencies in certain nutrients have been associated with worse symptoms. Chronic stress and its effects on cortisol and other hormones can also play a role. Blood sugar regulation matters because fluctuations in blood sugar can trigger or worsen symptoms. Inflammation appears to be a factor, with higher inflammatory markers associated with more severe PMS. Sleep quality affects hormonal regulation and mood. Finally, individual genetic variations affect hormone metabolism and neurotransmitter function.

## The Role of Diet and Blood Sugar Stability

The relationship between diet and PMS has been studied extensively, and while no single dietary intervention cures PMS, several dietary factors have been shown to influence symptom severity.

Blood sugar stability may be particularly important. During the luteal phase, the body tends toward increased insulin resistance, meaning cells become somewhat less responsive to insulin's signals<sup>4</sup>. This can lead to blood sugar fluctuations that trigger or worsen symptoms like irritability, fatigue, cravings, and mood swings. Eating in ways that promote stable blood sugar, by including protein and healthy fats with meals, avoiding refined sugars and processed carbohydrates, eating regular meals rather than skipping meals, and choosing complex carbohydrates with fibre, can help minimize these fluctuations.

The premenstrual cravings that many women experience, particularly for sweet or carbohydrate-rich foods, may actually represent the body's attempt to raise serotonin levels. Carbohydrates facilitate the entry of tryptophan into the brain, where it is converted to serotonin. However, satisfying these cravings with refined sugars and processed foods often backfires, leading to blood sugar spikes and crashes that worsen mood and energy. Complex carbohydrates and regular protein intake can help support serotonin production without the blood sugar rollercoaster.

Certain dietary patterns have been associated with reduced PMS symptoms. Higher intake of calcium-rich foods appears protective, with studies showing significant symptom reduction in women consuming adequate calcium<sup>5</sup>. Foods rich in B vitamins, particularly B6, may support neurotransmitter production and hormone metabolism. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish, flax, and walnuts have anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce pain and mood symptoms. Magnesium-rich foods like leafy greens, nuts, and seeds support muscle relaxation and mood.

Conversely, certain dietary factors have been associated with worse symptoms. High sodium intake can worsen bloating and fluid retention. Caffeine may intensify breast tenderness and anxiety symptoms in susceptible women. Alcohol can disrupt sleep, worsen mood symptoms, and interfere with hormone metabolism. A diet high in processed foods tends to be inflammatory and low in the nutrients that support hormonal health.

## Lifestyle Factors and Hormonal Balance

Beyond diet, several lifestyle factors significantly influence PMS severity and can be modified to support better hormonal balance.

Stress plays a major role in hormonal health. The stress hormone cortisol is produced from the same precursor as progesterone, and under conditions of chronic stress, the body may prioritize cortisol production at the expense of progesterone. This phenomenon, sometimes called the "cortisol steal," can contribute to relative progesterone deficiency and worsen premenstrual symptoms. Furthermore, chronic stress sensitizes the nervous system and can amplify the emotional symptoms of PMS. Stress management practices, including mindfulness, meditation, yoga, time in nature, and adequate leisure time, are not luxuries but important components of hormonal health.

Sleep deserves particular attention. Poor sleep disrupts hormonal regulation, impairs stress resilience, and worsens mood. Many women report that their sleep quality declines in the premenstrual week, which then exacerbates other symptoms in a vicious cycle. The drop in progesterone premenstrually may contribute to this, as progesterone has calming, sleep-promoting properties. Prioritizing sleep hygiene and addressing any underlying sleep issues can have ripple effects on hormonal symptoms. I have written more extensively about [evidence-based strategies for sleep optimization](/articles/sleep-optimization-evidence-based-strategies) that apply here.

Exercise has consistently been shown to reduce PMS symptoms. Physical activity improves mood through endorphin release, helps regulate blood sugar, reduces stress, and may favourably influence hormone metabolism<sup>6</sup>. Both aerobic exercise and strength training appear beneficial. The key is consistency rather than intensity, as moderate regular exercise tends to be more beneficial than sporadic intense workouts. Some women find they need to modify their exercise routine during the premenstrual week, perhaps choosing gentler activities like walking, swimming, or yoga when more vigorous exercise feels depleting.

## The Naturopathic Approach to Assessment

When a patient comes to me with PMS concerns, I take a comprehensive approach to understanding their individual situation. This begins with a detailed history of their symptoms, cycle patterns, overall health, and lifestyle factors. Understanding the specific symptoms, their timing, and their severity helps guide the assessment and treatment approach.

Hormone testing can be valuable in some cases, though it is not always necessary. Because hormones fluctuate throughout the cycle, the timing of testing matters greatly. Progesterone is best assessed in the mid-luteal phase, approximately one week after ovulation, when it should be at its peak. Testing too early or too late in the cycle can give misleading results. For women with irregular cycles, determining the optimal timing for testing can be challenging.

Testing options include standard blood tests for hormones like estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, and LH. More comprehensive assessments might include salivary hormone testing, which allows for multiple samples throughout the cycle, or urinary hormone metabolite testing, which reveals how hormones are being processed and eliminated. I discuss these options in detail in my article on [comprehensive hormone testing in Halifax](/articles/comprehensive-hormone-testing-halifax), which outlines the advantages and limitations of different testing methods.

Beyond sex hormones, I often consider thyroid function, as thyroid disorders are common in women and can cause or worsen symptoms that overlap with PMS. Cortisol and other markers of adrenal function may be relevant for women with significant stress or fatigue. Nutritional status, including iron, vitamin D, B12, and magnesium, can influence hormonal symptoms. Inflammatory markers can provide insight into underlying inflammation that may be driving symptoms.

## Supporting the Body Through the Cycle

The naturopathic approach to PMS focuses on supporting the body's own regulatory mechanisms rather than overriding them. This involves addressing underlying imbalances, providing nutritional support for healthy hormone production and metabolism, managing stress and supporting nervous system resilience, and aligning lifestyle habits with the body's natural rhythms.

Many women find it helpful to track their cycles and symptoms, noticing patterns that can inform their self-care. Some women benefit from adjusting their schedules when possible to accommodate the natural ebb and flow of energy throughout the cycle. Rather than fighting against the premenstrual tendency toward introversion and rest, allowing for more downtime during this phase can reduce the sense of swimming against the current.

Nutritional support is a cornerstone of the naturopathic approach to PMS. While I avoid prescribing specific supplements in educational articles, working with a naturopathic doctor or other qualified healthcare provider can help identify nutritional deficiencies or imbalances that may be contributing to symptoms and determine appropriate interventions. [Clinical nutrition](/clinical-nutrition) is one of the primary tools in naturopathic medicine, and dietary changes along with targeted nutritional support can make a meaningful difference for many women with PMS.

[Herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine) offers another avenue of support. Traditional systems of medicine around the world have long used plants to support women's hormonal health and ease menstrual complaints. Modern research has validated some of these traditional uses, showing that certain herbs can influence hormone levels, support liver detoxification of hormones, calm the nervous system, or reduce inflammation. The appropriate herbs depend on the individual woman's symptoms, constitution, and health history, which is why working with a qualified practitioner is important.

## When to Seek Additional Help

While many women can successfully manage PMS through diet, lifestyle, and natural approaches, some situations warrant additional medical evaluation or intervention. Symptoms that are severely impairing daily function, causing significant relationship difficulties, or not responding to basic interventions should be evaluated by a healthcare provider. PMDD in particular may require medication as part of a comprehensive treatment approach.

Symptoms that are new, changing, or unusual should be investigated to rule out other conditions. PMS symptoms that do not follow the typical pattern of appearing in the luteal phase and resolving with menstruation may indicate other health issues that mimic PMS, such as thyroid dysfunction, depression, or anxiety disorders that happen to be influenced by hormonal fluctuations without being true PMS.

Women in Halifax and throughout Nova Scotia who are struggling with PMS or other hormonal concerns can access comprehensive evaluation and natural treatment approaches through naturopathic medicine. As a naturopathic doctor, I work collaboratively with patients' other healthcare providers to ensure coordinated care, particularly for more severe cases that may benefit from an integrative approach combining conventional and natural therapies.

## A Whole-Person Perspective

PMS is not simply a hormonal problem requiring a hormonal solution. It is a condition that reflects the interplay between hormones, neurotransmitters, nutrition, stress, sleep, inflammation, and individual susceptibility. Effective management addresses these multiple factors rather than focusing narrowly on any single element.

For many women, understanding their cycle and its influence on their physical and emotional state is itself empowering. Rather than viewing premenstrual changes as pathology to be suppressed, some women find value in seeing this time as information about their overall health and balance. Persistent severe PMS may be signaling that something in the body's regulatory systems needs attention, whether that is nutrition, stress levels, sleep, or underlying hormonal imbalance.

The naturopathic approach honours this perspective while providing practical tools for reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. By supporting the body's innate capacity for balance through targeted nutrition, stress management, appropriate lifestyle modifications, and when indicated herbal or other natural therapies, many women can achieve significant improvement in their premenstrual symptoms and overall hormonal health.

If you are experiencing troublesome PMS or other menstrual concerns, I encourage you to seek evaluation and support rather than simply accepting symptoms as inevitable. Whether you work with a naturopathic doctor, a conventional physician, or ideally a collaborative team, effective help is available. Your experience of your cycle is not something you simply have to endure but can often be significantly improved with the right approach.
