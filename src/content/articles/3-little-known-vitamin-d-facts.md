## Vitamin D is a Hormone
Vitamin D is structured and functions much more like a hormone than a vitamin. In fact, vitamin D has more in common with hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol than it does with vitamins A, B<sup>[1](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/[2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20736230)</sup>/491S.full)2 or C<sup>1</sup>. A [Vitamin D receptor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20736230) has been identified on 229 different genes which are all strongly impacted by exposure to vitamin D<sup>2</sup>. This is an important finding because vitamins don’t act through binding to receptors but hormones do. Vitamins are also classified by a need to be obtained through the diet, whereas vitamin D can be obtained in sufficient quantities solely from skin exposure to sunlight.

## Vitamin D Affects Cancer Risk
There has been encouraging evidence emerging over the past few years on the role vitamin D plays in [[cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14652238)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880848). The mechanism by which vitamin D helps cancer patients is thought to be through [slowing spread, slowing differentiation and by directly killing cancer cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20<sup>[9](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14652238)</sup><sup>3</sup>3<sup>[6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880848)</sup>9<sup>[4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21709199)</sup>5). Vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk [of](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880848) [developing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17556697) [skin cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21709199) in people at high risk for skin cancer4, decreases the risk of developing [breast](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17549593) cancer<sup>[5,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17549593)</sup><sup>[6,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880848)</sup> and also decreases the risk of developing [colon](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671222) cancer6,<sup>[7,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17556697)</sup><sup>[8,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671222)</sup>9. Research has also indicated that Vitamin D supplementation can help to control the [spread of prostate cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22508710)<sup>10</sup>.
More recent research has suggested that vitamin D supplementation also helps [decrease adverse effects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10604343)<sup>11</sup> associated with some cancer treatments, including bone pain and bone mineral density depletion. Some of the positive effects of vitamin D supplementation in cancer patients have been attributed to the fact that many cancer patients are vitamin D deficient or become deficient during their cancer treatment<sup>[12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493367)</sup>.

## Vitamin D Affects Blood Pressure
It has been suggested that vitamin D may help to control blood pressure by interacting with blood-calcium levels and thereby affecting vascular smooth muscle “tightness”, which is indeed an important factor in blood pressure<sup>[13](http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/56/5/774.short)</sup>. Over the past few years evidence has emerged showing that vitamin D supplementation can help to control blood pressure in [healthy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23487599) [people](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11297596)<sup>[14,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23487599)</sup><sup>[15](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11297596)</sup>, in people with [vitamin D deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22854639)<sup>16</sup>, in [diabetics](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23168851)<sup>17</sup> and in women with [polycystic ovarian syndrome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22780885)<sup>18</sup>. Considering the negative effects of high blood pressure on the cardiovascular system, this is an important finding.

## Safety
Although vitamin D supplementation can have some significant benefits for certain groups of people it is not a magic bullet by any means. Vitamin D supplementation has the potential for adverse reactions in people with hyperparathyroidism, kidney disease, high blood-calcium levels, low blood pressure, immune disorders, certain cancers, in breastfeeding mothers and in infants. It is a good idea to consult your naturopathic doctor regarding whether you should take vitamin D and what dose is appropriate. To get a rough idea of how much vitamin D you can and should get from sun exposure daily check out this [online calculator](http://nadir.nilu.no/~olaeng/fastrt/VitD-ez_quartMED.html) from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research.
