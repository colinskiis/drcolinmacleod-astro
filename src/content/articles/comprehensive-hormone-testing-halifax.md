If you've been experiencing fatigue, mood changes, weight fluctuations, low libido or simply don't feel like yourself, your hormones may hold the answers. Yet getting comprehensive hormone testing in Nova Scotia can be frustrating. Many family doctors order only basic panels, MSI coverage restricts which tests can be requisitioned and with physician shortages across the province, getting any testing at all presents a challenge for many.

The good news is that you can access comprehensive hormone testing in Halifax without a family doctor's requisition through [private lab testing services](/lab-testing).

## Sex Hormones: Beyond Reproductive Function

Estrogen, progesterone and testosterone are often thought of primarily in terms of reproductive function, but their influence extends far beyond fertility. These hormones affect bone density, cardiovascular health, brain function, mood, energy, body composition and skin integrity. Their decline with age, and the imbalances that can occur at any age, produce symptoms that significantly impact quality of life.

Estrogen in women maintains bone density, supports cardiovascular health, contributes to cognitive function and keeps tissues throughout the body healthy and resilient. As estrogen declines during perimenopause and menopause, women may experience hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood changes, brain fog and accelerated bone loss. Conversely, estrogen excess, often occurring relative to progesterone in a pattern called estrogen dominance and can cause heavy periods, breast tenderness, weight gain, fibroids and increased cancer risk.<sup>1</sup>

Progesterone serves as estrogen's balancing partner. It promotes calm and restful sleep, protects against certain cancers and supports pregnancy. Low progesterone manifests as anxiety, insomnia, irregular periods, severe PMS and difficulty maintaining pregnancy. Many women with these symptoms have never had their progesterone levels checked.

Testosterone, while present in much lower amounts in women than men, nonetheless plays important roles in both sexes. In men, testosterone maintains muscle mass, bone density, libido, energy, mood and cognitive sharpness. The gradual decline that occurs with age, sometimes accelerated by stress, poor sleep, obesity or chronic illness, produces symptoms often attributed simply to "getting older": fatigue, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of muscle mass, increased body fat, depression and cognitive decline. In women, testosterone supports energy, libido, muscle maintenance and mood. Both high and low levels can cause problems. Elevated testosterone in women may indicate PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and manifest as acne, facial hair and irregular periods.<sup>2</sup>

Testing these hormones appropriately requires attention to timing. For menstruating women, progesterone is best measured during the luteal phase (days 19-21 of the cycle), while FSH and LH provide more information when tested early in the cycle (days 2-4). Testosterone and estrogen can be tested at various points depending on the clinical question. These nuances matter for accurate interpretation.

## The Adrenal Hormones: Cortisol and DHEA

The adrenal glands sit atop the kidneys and produce hormones essential for stress response, energy regulation and overall vitality. Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, follows a natural daily rhythm, highest in the morning to help you wake and lowest at night to allow sleep. DHEA, often called the "vitality hormone," serves as a precursor to both testosterone and estrogen while also having effects of its own.

When stress becomes chronic, the adrenal system can become dysregulated. In the early stages of chronic stress, cortisol production increases, producing anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain (especially around the abdomen), elevated blood sugar and suppressed immunity. Over time, if stress continues unabated, the system may become depleted, resulting in low cortisol, profound fatigue, difficulty handling stress, low blood pressure, salt cravings and what patients often describe as feeling "burned out."<sup>3</sup>

The cortisol-to-DHEA ratio provides particularly valuable clinical information. DHEA tends to decline with age, but chronic stress accelerates this decline. A high cortisol-to-DHEA ratio indicates the body is producing stress hormones at the expense of vitality hormones, a pattern associated with increased abdominal fat storage, impaired immune function, accelerated aging, mood disturbances and cognitive decline.<sup>4</sup>

Testing cortisol presents unique challenges because a single blood draw provides only a snapshot of a hormone that should vary throughout the day. Saliva testing allows for multiple collections (typically upon waking, late morning, afternoon and evening) to assess the cortisol rhythm. This reveals patterns that single-point testing misses: the person whose cortisol is low in the morning (explaining why they can't wake up) but elevated at night (explaining why they can't sleep), or the person with a blunted cortisol response who lacks the normal morning peak that provides energy and alertness.

## Testing Methods: Blood, Saliva and Urine

Different testing methods offer different advantages, and the best choice depends on which hormones are being assessed and what clinical questions need answering.

Blood testing remains the gold standard for most hormones, particularly sex hormones and DHEA-S (the sulfated, storage form of DHEA). Blood tests measure total hormone levels, are widely validated and allow easy comparison to established reference ranges. The limitation is that blood tests provide only a single point-in-time measurement, which matters less for relatively stable hormones but more for cortisol with its daily rhythm.

Saliva testing excels for cortisol assessment because samples can be collected at multiple points throughout the day without requiring repeated blood draws. Saliva also measures "free" (unbound) hormones rather than total levels, which may better reflect what's actually available to tissues. For cortisol rhythm assessment, saliva testing is generally preferable to blood.

Urine testing, particularly the DUTCH (Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones) test, provides the most detailed hormone assessment available. Beyond measuring hormone levels, it reveals how the body metabolizes hormones. This information can identify cancer-risk pathways in estrogen metabolism, explain why someone with "normal" hormone levels still has symptoms and guide more targeted interventions. The tradeoff is greater complexity and cost.<sup>5</sup>

We discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach during consultation, helping you determine which testing method best fits your clinical situation and budget.

## The Interpretation Difference

Perhaps more important than which tests are ordered is how results are interpreted. Standard laboratory reference ranges are derived from general population averages, which include both healthy individuals and those with undiagnosed dysfunction. A result within the "normal" range simply means you fall somewhere within the distribution of the general population. It doesn't mean the level is optimal for you.

Reference ranges for ferritin in women often extend as low as 12 ng/mL, yet energy and function typically require levels above 50 ng/mL. Vitamin D reference ranges consider 30 nmol/L adequate, yet optimal function requires 100-150 nmol/L. The same principle applies to hormone testing. Functional interpretation considers where values fall relative to optimal ranges, not just whether they avoid disease cutoffs, allowing for earlier intervention and better outcomes.

## What About Thyroid?

Thyroid dysfunction often accompanies or mimics sex hormone and adrenal imbalances. Many of the symptoms that bring people to hormone testing, including fatigue, weight changes, mood disturbances and cognitive issues, can stem from thyroid problems. For this reason, comprehensive hormone assessment typically includes thyroid evaluation.

For detailed information about thyroid testing, including why standard TSH testing often misses dysfunction and what a complete thyroid panel should include, see our [Complete Thyroid Testing](/thyroid-testing) page.

## Who Should Consider Hormone Testing?

Comprehensive hormone testing provides valuable information for anyone experiencing fatigue that doesn't improve with rest, unexplained weight changes despite consistent diet and exercise, mood disturbances including depression, anxiety or irritability, sleep problems ranging from insomnia to unrefreshing sleep, decreased libido or sexual dysfunction, menstrual irregularities or severe PMS, perimenopausal symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats, brain fog or difficulty concentrating, hair loss or changes in skin quality or difficulty building muscle or recovering from exercise.

Testing is particularly valuable when symptoms have been dismissed or attributed to stress and aging without proper investigation, when previous testing has been limited to basic panels that don't tell the complete story or when you want to understand your hormonal baseline while optimizing health rather than waiting for problems to develop.

## The Testing Process

Comprehensive hormone testing begins with an initial consultation where we review your symptoms, health history and goals. This conversation guides which tests will be most informative for your situation. Hormone imbalances rarely occur in isolation. Understanding the full picture often requires considering sex hormones, adrenal function, thyroid status and sometimes related factors like blood sugar regulation and inflammation.

After determining appropriate testing, you receive requisitions for sample collection. Blood tests are collected at partner laboratories in Halifax. Saliva and urine tests are collected at home following specific instructions regarding timing. Results typically return within five to seven business days for standard blood work, or two to three weeks for specialty panels like the DUTCH test.

Once results are available, we schedule a follow-up to review findings together. You'll understand not just what your numbers are, but what they mean in the context of your symptoms and health goals. From this understanding, we develop actionable recommendations, whether dietary changes, targeted supplementation, stress management strategies or in some cases referral for hormone replacement therapy.
