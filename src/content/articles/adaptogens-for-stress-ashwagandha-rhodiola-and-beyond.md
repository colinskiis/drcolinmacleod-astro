## The Rise of Adaptogens

Adaptogens have become one of the most popular categories of supplements, with ashwagandha in particular appearing everywhere from dedicated supplements to coffee creamers and energy drinks. The promise is appealing: natural substances that help your body "adapt" to stress and maintain balance. But what does the science actually show? Here's what the evidence tells us about these trending herbs.

## What Are Adaptogens?

The term "adaptogen" was coined by Soviet scientists in the 1940s-50s to describe substances that help the body resist various stressors, whether physical, chemical, or biological, while maintaining normal physiological function.

The key characteristics that define adaptogens include producing a non-specific response that improves resistance to multiple stressors, having a normalizing effect that brings parameters toward normal regardless of direction of change, and being relatively safe with minimal side effects.

Adaptogens are thought to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the body's central stress response system. They may help modulate cortisol production, stress-activated proteins, neurotransmitter balance, and inflammatory pathways.

## Ashwagandha: The Most-Studied Adaptogen

Ashwagandha (*Withania somnifera*) has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years and has accumulated the strongest modern research base among adaptogens.

### What the Research Shows

**Stress and anxiety:**

A 2024 meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials involving 558 patients found significant benefits of ashwagandha compared to placebo, including reductions in perceived stress, anxiety scores, and serum cortisol levels<sup>1</sup>.

A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis published in *BJPsych Open* confirmed these findings, concluding that "ashwagandha supplementation is safe and effective in reducing stress and anxiety in adult patients, resulting in a statistically significant reduction of cortisol levels"<sup>2</sup>.

**Sleep:**

Research shows ashwagandha may improve sleep quality, particularly in stressed individuals. The mechanism may involve GABAergic activity, the same pathway targeted by some sleep medications.

**Athletic performance:**

Some studies suggest benefits for strength, recovery, and cardiorespiratory endurance, though the evidence is less robust than for stress reduction<sup>3</sup>.

### Important Considerations

Quality varies significantly among ashwagandha supplements. The content of active compounds called withanolides differs between products, and standardized extracts are generally preferred.

Ashwagandha may increase thyroid hormone levels. Those with hyperthyroidism or taking thyroid medications should consult their healthcare provider before use.

The herb should be avoided during pregnancy due to safety concerns. Rare cases of liver injury have been reported, though causality is not established.

## Rhodiola: The Energy Adaptogen

Rhodiola (*Rhodiola rosea*) has a long history of use in Russian and Scandinavian traditional medicine for fatigue, weakness, and stress. I've written about [Rhodiola's benefits for stress and fatigue](/articles/herbal-spotlight-rhodiola) previously, but let's review the key findings.

### What the Research Shows

**Fatigue:**

Multiple clinical trials have found rhodiola effective for various types of fatigue, including stress-induced fatigue in physicians during night duty<sup>4</sup>, mental fatigue in students during exams<sup>5</sup>, and general life-stress related fatigue<sup>6</sup>.

**Mental performance:**

Research suggests rhodiola may improve cognitive function under stress, particularly attention, processing speed, and mental endurance.

**Mild to moderate depression:**

A clinical trial found rhodiola extract improved symptoms of mild to moderate depression compared to placebo<sup>7</sup>.

**Mechanism:**

Rhodiola's active compounds (rosavins and salidrosides) appear to modulate serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters involved in mood, energy, and stress response.

### Practical Considerations

Rhodiola tends to be stimulating rather than sedating, so it's typically taken in the morning or early afternoon. It is generally well-tolerated, with mild side effects including dry mouth and dizziness in some individuals.

## Other Notable Adaptogens

### Eleuthero (Siberian Ginseng)

*Eleutherococcus senticosus* was one of the original plants studied by Soviet researchers. Evidence suggests benefits for physical endurance, immune function, and mental performance under stress.

### Holy Basil (Tulsi)

*Ocimum sanctum* is revered in Ayurvedic medicine. Research indicates potential benefits for stress and anxiety reduction, blood sugar management, and general well-being.

### Schisandra

*Schisandra chinensis* is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Studies suggest improved mental performance under stress, liver-protective effects, and antioxidant activity.

### Asian Ginseng (Panax ginseng)

One of the most widely used herbs globally, Asian ginseng may improve energy and reduce fatigue, with potential benefits for cognitive function and immune-modulating effects.

## Choosing and Using Adaptogens

### Who Might Benefit?

Adaptogens may be most helpful for those experiencing chronic stress, people with stress-related fatigue, individuals with mild anxiety symptoms, those recovering from illness or burnout, and athletes looking for recovery support.

### Who Should Be Cautious?

Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid adaptogens due to limited safety data. Those with autoimmune conditions may find the immune-modulating effects problematic. People taking medications, particularly for mood, thyroid, or blood pressure, should consult with their healthcare provider. Those with hormone-sensitive conditions should also exercise caution.

### Practical Guidelines

Rather than combining multiple herbs, start with one adaptogen to assess your response. If you're primarily anxious or stressed, ashwagandha tends to be calming. If you're primarily fatigued, rhodiola tends to be more energizing. Either may help with mixed symptoms.

Look for quality products with standardized extracts that specify active compound levels, third-party testing for purity, and reputable brands.

Give adaptogens time to work. They typically work gradually rather than immediately. Address fundamentals first, as adaptogens work best when basics are covered, including sleep, nutrition, exercise, and stress management practices.

## The Bigger Picture

Adaptogens can be helpful tools for stress management, but they're not a replacement for addressing the sources of stress or building sustainable coping strategies.

The most effective approach combines lifestyle modification including [quality sleep](/articles/sleep-optimization-evidence-based-strategies), exercise, and nutrition with stress management practices such as meditation, breathing exercises, and time in nature. Appropriate supplementation when indicated and professional support for significant stress or anxiety round out a comprehensive approach.
