## When Acne Persists Past Adolescence

Many people expect acne to disappear after their teenage years. For a significant number of adults, particularly women, this expectation goes unmet. Adult acne affects up to 50% of women in their twenties and 25% of women in their forties<sup>1</sup>. This persistent or late-onset acne is frequently hormonal in nature, driven by factors very different from the acne of adolescence.

In my naturopathic practice in Halifax, I see many women frustrated by acne that appeared in their twenties, thirties or even forties, often after years of clear skin. They have tried countless topical products with limited success. What they often have not addressed is the hormonal and metabolic factors driving their breakouts from within.

Hormonal acne typically looks different from typical teenage acne. It tends to appear along the jawline, chin and lower cheeks. Breakouts are often deep, cystic and painful rather than superficial whiteheads. Flares frequently correspond with menstrual cycles, often worsening in the week before menstruation. The skin may appear clear for part of the month, then break out predictably at certain times.

Understanding the mechanisms behind hormonal acne reveals why topical treatments alone often fail, and why addressing the underlying hormonal and metabolic factors can finally bring lasting improvement.

## The Hormonal Mechanisms Behind Acne

### Androgens: The Primary Drivers

Androgens, often called "male hormones" though women produce them too, are the primary hormonal drivers of acne. Testosterone and its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulate sebaceous glands to produce more sebum (oil). Excess sebum combines with dead skin cells to clog pores, creating an environment where acne-causing bacteria thrive.

Women with hormonal acne may have elevated total testosterone, elevated free testosterone (the active, unbound form), normal testosterone but elevated DHT due to increased conversion or normal androgen levels but heightened skin sensitivity to normal amounts.

This last point is important. Some women with hormonal acne have completely normal androgen levels on blood tests. Their skin simply responds more strongly to the androgens present. This explains why two women with identical hormone levels can have very different skin.

### The Role of SHBG

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a protein that binds testosterone in the blood, rendering it inactive. Only free (unbound) testosterone can affect tissues like the sebaceous glands. When SHBG levels are low, more testosterone is free and available to stimulate oil production.

Factors that lower SHBG include insulin resistance, high sugar intake, obesity, low thyroid function and certain medications. This is one reason why dietary and metabolic factors have such a significant impact on hormonal acne.

### Insulin and Acne

Insulin resistance is a major contributor to hormonal acne that is often overlooked. When cells become resistant to insulin, the body produces more insulin to compensate. Elevated insulin directly stimulates androgen production from the ovaries, reduces SHBG levels (increasing free testosterone), stimulates sebum production directly and promotes inflammation.

This insulin-acne connection explains why dietary changes can be so effective for hormonal acne, and why women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by insulin resistance, so frequently struggle with acne. For more on the PCOS connection, see my article on [natural approaches to PCOS](/articles/pcos-natural-approaches).

### Estrogen and Progesterone

The balance between estrogen and progesterone also influences acne. Estrogen generally has a positive effect on skin, which is why many women notice clearer skin during pregnancy (when estrogen is high) and on birth control pills containing estrogen.

Progesterone's effects are more complex. While often beneficial for skin, progesterone can be converted to androgens. Additionally, synthetic progestins found in some birth control methods can have androgenic activity, sometimes worsening acne.

The premenstrual acne flare many women experience results from dropping estrogen and progesterone levels in the days before menstruation, leaving androgen effects relatively unopposed.

### Cortisol and Stress

Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which promotes acne through several mechanisms. Cortisol stimulates sebum production, impairs wound healing and skin barrier function, increases inflammation, worsens insulin resistance and can stimulate adrenal androgen production.

Many women notice their skin worsens during stressful periods. This is not coincidence or imagination but a real physiological response.

## Beyond Hormones: Other Contributing Factors

### Gut Health and the Gut-Skin Axis

The connection between gut health and skin health has been recognized for nearly a century, though only recently has science begun to understand the mechanisms. Studies consistently show alterations in gut bacteria composition in acne patients compared to those with clear skin<sup>2</sup>.

The gut affects skin through several pathways. Gut bacteria influence systemic inflammation, which contributes to acne. Dysbiosis can impair hormone metabolism and excretion. Intestinal permeability ("leaky gut") allows inflammatory compounds into circulation. The gut microbiome affects insulin sensitivity.

Addressing gut health often improves skin, even when the connection is not immediately obvious.

### Diet and Glycemic Load

The relationship between diet and acne was long dismissed by dermatology, but research has rehabilitated this connection. High glycemic foods, those that rapidly raise blood sugar, consistently worsen acne through the insulin-androgen mechanisms described above<sup>3</sup>.

Dairy, particularly skim milk, has also been associated with acne in multiple studies<sup>4</sup>. The mechanism may involve hormones naturally present in milk, dairy's effects on insulin and IGF-1 or other factors not yet fully understood.

### Nutrient Deficiencies

Several nutrient deficiencies can contribute to acne. Zinc is essential for skin health, immune function and hormone metabolism. Deficiency is common and associated with acne severity<sup>5</sup>. Vitamin A regulates skin cell turnover and sebum production. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation. Vitamin D has immune-modulating effects.

A nutrient-poor diet may contribute to acne both through what it contains (refined sugars, processed foods) and what it lacks (vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids).

### Topical Irritation and the Skin Barrier

While hormonal acne is driven from within, external factors can exacerbate it. Over-washing, harsh products and certain ingredients can damage the skin barrier, increase inflammation and worsen breakouts.

Many people with acne over-treat their skin, using multiple harsh products in an attempt to dry out blemishes. This often backfires, damaging the skin barrier and triggering more inflammation. A gentler approach is usually more effective for hormonal acne.

## Dietary Approaches to Clear Skin

### Low Glycemic Eating

Reducing the glycemic load of your diet is one of the most evidence-based dietary interventions for acne. A 2007 study found that a low glycemic diet significantly reduced acne lesions compared to a conventional diet, with improvements in insulin sensitivity paralleling skin improvements<sup>6</sup>.

Practical applications include choosing whole grains over refined grains, including protein and healthy fat with every meal, emphasizing vegetables at each meal, avoiding sugary drinks and sweets and limiting white bread, white rice and white pasta.

### Dairy Reduction

Given the associations between dairy and acne, a trial elimination is reasonable for those with hormonal acne. Remove all dairy for four weeks and observe any changes in skin.

If dairy is a trigger, you may not need to eliminate it permanently. Many people find they can tolerate fermented dairy (yogurt, kefir) or hard cheeses better than milk. Some tolerate small amounts but flare with larger quantities.

### Anti-Inflammatory Foods

Emphasizing anti-inflammatory foods supports skin healing. Fatty fish provide anti-inflammatory omega-3s. Colorful vegetables and berries contain polyphenols that combat inflammation. Olive oil contains oleocanthal, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea provides EGCG, which may reduce sebum production.

### Foods to Minimize

Beyond high glycemic foods and dairy, other dietary factors may worsen acne for some individuals. These include whey protein supplements (strongly associated with acne), excessive omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils, chocolate (the evidence is mixed, but some individuals clearly react) and alcohol, which affects hormones and promotes inflammation.

## Supplements for Hormonal Acne

### Zinc

Zinc is one of the most well-studied nutrients for acne. It reduces inflammation, inhibits the growth of acne-causing bacteria, reduces androgen effects and supports skin healing. Multiple studies show zinc supplementation reduces acne lesions<sup>7</sup>.

Zinc picolinate or zinc citrate are well-absorbed forms. Typical doses range from 30-50mg daily. Taking zinc with food reduces nausea, a common side effect. Long-term zinc supplementation should be balanced with copper to prevent deficiency.

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Fish oil reduces inflammation and may help modulate sebum composition. Some studies show improvement in acne with omega-3 supplementation<sup>8</sup>. Typical doses are 2-3 grams of combined EPA and DHA daily.

### Probiotics

Given the gut-skin connection, probiotics may help improve acne by reducing systemic inflammation, improving gut barrier function and modulating the microbiome. While research is still emerging, some studies show benefit<sup>9</sup>.

Strains studied for skin health include Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Both oral and topical probiotics may have benefits.

### DIM (Diindolylmethane)

DIM is a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables that supports healthy estrogen metabolism and may help reduce androgen activity. It is particularly useful for women whose acne worsens premenstrually or who have signs of estrogen dominance.

Typical doses are 100-200mg daily. DIM is best taken with food for absorption.

### Spearmint Tea

Spearmint has anti-androgen effects. Studies show that drinking spearmint tea twice daily can reduce free testosterone levels and improve symptoms of excess androgens, including acne and hirsutism<sup>10</sup>. This is a simple, safe intervention worth trying.

### Vitamin A

Vitamin A regulates skin cell turnover and sebum production. While prescription retinoids are powerful acne treatments, oral vitamin A supplementation may provide milder benefits. However, vitamin A must be used cautiously as it can be toxic in excess and is contraindicated in pregnancy.

For most people, eating vitamin A-rich foods (liver, egg yolks, orange vegetables) and taking moderate-dose supplements (5,000-10,000 IU daily) is safe and potentially helpful.

### Berberine

For acne driven by insulin resistance, berberine is a powerful insulin-sensitizing supplement. By improving insulin sensitivity and reducing insulin levels, berberine can decrease androgen production and improve acne. For more on berberine, see my article on [berberine's metabolic effects](/articles/berberine-natures-ozempic).

## Lifestyle Factors

### Stress Management

Given cortisol's effects on skin, stress management is not optional for those with hormonal acne. Effective approaches include regular exercise (which also improves insulin sensitivity), adequate sleep, mindfulness or meditation practice, setting boundaries and addressing sources of chronic stress.

### Sleep

Poor sleep worsens insulin resistance, increases inflammation and elevates cortisol, all of which promote acne. Prioritizing seven to nine hours of quality sleep supports skin health along with overall wellbeing.

For more on optimizing sleep, see my article on [evidence-based sleep strategies](/articles/sleep-optimization-evidence-based-strategies).

### Exercise

Regular physical activity improves insulin sensitivity, reduces androgens, lowers stress hormones and supports overall hormonal balance. Both aerobic exercise and resistance training are beneficial. However, heavy weightlifting combined with high-protein supplements (especially whey) can sometimes worsen acne.

If you exercise, wash your face promptly afterward to remove sweat and bacteria.

## Topical Considerations

While hormonal acne must be addressed from within, gentle, supportive topical care can help.

### What to Avoid

Harsh cleansers that strip the skin, over-exfoliation, multiple active ingredients used simultaneously, comedogenic (pore-clogging) oils and products and frequent touching or picking at the skin should all be avoided.

### What Helps

Gentle, pH-balanced cleansers preserve the skin barrier. Niacinamide (vitamin B3) reduces inflammation and sebum production. Non-comedogenic moisturizers maintain barrier function. Targeted spot treatments with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide can be used sparingly. Sunscreen protects against post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

For those interested in natural topical options, tea tree oil has antimicrobial effects and is well-studied for acne<sup>11</sup>. Green tea extract, aloe vera and witch hazel may also provide benefits.

## When to Seek Additional Support

Some cases of hormonal acne benefit from conventional medical treatment. Consider consulting a healthcare provider if acne is severe or cystic, if natural approaches have not provided sufficient improvement after three to six months, if there are signs of underlying hormonal conditions such as PCOS, if acne is causing significant psychological distress or if you need support for scarring.

Options may include prescription topicals (retinoids, antibiotics), oral medications (spironolactone, birth control pills, isotretinoin) or referral to a dermatologist or endocrinologist.

## A Comprehensive Approach in Halifax

Clearing hormonal acne requires addressing root causes rather than just treating symptoms. For most women, this means improving insulin sensitivity through diet and lifestyle, supporting healthy hormone metabolism, addressing gut health, reducing inflammation and managing stress.

While this approach requires more effort than applying a topical cream, the results are often more lasting and come with additional benefits for overall health.
