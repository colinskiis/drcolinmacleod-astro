## The Growing Burden of Digestive Disorders

Digestive problems have become remarkably common. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects approximately 10-15% of the population worldwide, making it one of the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorders<sup>1</sup>. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), while less common, affects over 300,000 Canadians and continues to rise in prevalence<sup>2</sup>. In my naturopathic practice in Halifax, digestive concerns are among the most frequent reasons patients seek care.

These conditions significantly impact quality of life. Beyond the physical discomfort of pain, bloating and altered bowel habits, they affect work productivity, social activities, mental health and overall wellbeing. Many patients feel their concerns have been dismissed or that conventional approaches have failed to adequately address their symptoms.

The good news is that naturopathic medicine offers effective approaches to both IBS and IBD. By addressing underlying factors such as gut microbiome dysfunction, food sensitivities, stress and inflammation, many patients experience substantial improvement in their symptoms and quality of life.

## IBS vs. IBD: Understanding the Difference

Though the names sound similar and symptoms can overlap, IBS and IBD are fundamentally different conditions. Understanding this distinction is crucial for appropriate treatment.

### Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder. "Functional" means that the symptoms are real and often severe, but standard medical tests do not reveal structural abnormalities or visible disease. The gut appears normal on colonoscopy and imaging, yet it functions abnormally.

IBS is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with changes in stool frequency or form. It is classified into subtypes based on predominant symptoms. IBS-D is diarrhea-predominant, with frequent loose stools. IBS-C is constipation-predominant, with infrequent, hard or difficult-to-pass stools. IBS-M is mixed type, alternating between diarrhea and constipation. IBS-U is unsubtyped, not fitting clearly into other categories.

Other common symptoms include bloating and distension, urgency, incomplete evacuation, mucus in stool and symptoms worsened by eating.

IBS does not cause inflammation visible on biopsy, does not damage the intestinal lining and does not increase cancer risk. However, this does not mean it is "not real" or "just in your head." IBS involves measurable changes in gut function, motility, sensation, microbiome composition and gut-brain communication.

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

IBD comprises two main conditions: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Unlike IBS, IBD involves visible inflammation and damage to the digestive tract.

**Crohn's disease** can affect any part of the digestive tract from mouth to anus, though it most commonly involves the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the colon. Inflammation is often patchy (skip lesions) and can extend through the full thickness of the intestinal wall, potentially leading to complications such as strictures, fistulas and abscesses.

**Ulcerative colitis** affects only the colon and rectum. Inflammation is continuous (not patchy) and limited to the inner lining of the intestine. It typically begins in the rectum and extends upward.

IBD symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, urgency, fatigue, weight loss, fever and extraintestinal manifestations affecting joints, skin and eyes. Unlike IBS, IBD can be seen on colonoscopy and confirmed by biopsy showing characteristic inflammatory changes.

IBD requires medical management and often immunosuppressive medications. Natural therapies can play an important supportive role, but they should complement rather than replace appropriate medical care.

## The Underlying Causes of IBS

Research has identified multiple factors that contribute to IBS. Most patients have several of these factors present simultaneously.

### Gut Dysbiosis

The gut microbiome of IBS patients differs significantly from healthy controls<sup>3</sup>. There is typically reduced microbial diversity and altered ratios of beneficial to harmful bacteria. This dysbiosis affects gut function in numerous ways, influencing intestinal motility, gas production, intestinal permeability, immune function and neurotransmitter production.

### Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)

SIBO occurs when bacteria that normally reside in the colon migrate into and overpopulate the small intestine. Studies suggest SIBO is present in up to 78% of IBS patients<sup>4</sup>. These misplaced bacteria ferment carbohydrates before they can be properly absorbed, producing hydrogen or methane gas that causes bloating, distension and altered motility.

SIBO is particularly associated with IBS-D (hydrogen-producing bacteria) and IBS-C (methane-producing archaea). Testing for SIBO through breath testing can help guide treatment, and addressing SIBO often significantly improves symptoms.

### Post-Infectious IBS

Approximately 10% of people develop IBS following a bout of acute gastroenteritis such as food poisoning or traveler's diarrhea<sup>5</sup>. This "post-infectious IBS" may persist for months or years and is thought to result from lasting changes to the gut microbiome, immune activation and intestinal permeability triggered by the initial infection.

### Food Sensitivities

Unlike true food allergies, food sensitivities do not involve IgE-mediated immune reactions and are not detected by standard allergy testing. However, many IBS patients clearly react to certain foods with worsening symptoms.

Common triggers include fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), gluten (even without celiac disease), dairy, caffeine, alcohol and artificial sweeteners. Identifying and reducing individual trigger foods often provides significant relief.

### Gut-Brain Axis Dysfunction

The gut and brain communicate bidirectionally through neural, hormonal and immune pathways. This "gut-brain axis" explains why stress so often triggers or worsens IBS symptoms.

Patients with IBS frequently have visceral hypersensitivity, meaning their gut nervous system is overly reactive, perceiving normal sensations as painful. Stress amplifies this sensitivity. Many IBS patients have histories of anxiety, depression or trauma and psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and gut-directed hypnotherapy are among the most effective treatments for IBS<sup>6</sup>.

For more on the gut-brain connection, see my article on [how gut health affects mental health](/articles/gut-brain-connection-mental-health).

### Intestinal Permeability

Increased intestinal permeability, sometimes called "leaky gut," allows substances to cross the intestinal barrier that normally would not. This can trigger immune activation and inflammation and has been documented in IBS patients<sup>7</sup>. Factors that worsen intestinal permeability include dysbiosis, SIBO, chronic stress, certain medications and dietary factors.

## The Underlying Causes of IBD

IBD results from a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, immune dysregulation and microbiome alterations.

### Genetic Factors

Over 200 genetic variants have been associated with IBD risk. However, genetics alone do not determine who develops the disease. Many people with high-risk genes never develop IBD, while some without identified risk genes do.

### Environmental Triggers

The rising incidence of IBD, particularly in newly industrialized countries, points to environmental factors. Implicated factors include Western diet (high in processed foods, low in fiber), antibiotic use (especially in childhood), reduced microbial exposure (the "hygiene hypothesis"), smoking (increases Crohn's risk, oddly seems protective against UC) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Immune Dysregulation

IBD involves inappropriate immune responses against gut bacteria or the intestinal lining itself. The immune system, which should tolerate the normal gut microbiome, instead attacks it, causing chronic inflammation.

### Microbiome Alterations

IBD patients have significant gut dysbiosis, with reduced diversity and specific changes in bacterial composition. Whether dysbiosis is a cause or consequence of inflammation remains debated, but it clearly perpetuates the inflammatory cycle.

## Dietary Approaches to IBS

Diet is perhaps the most important intervention for IBS. The right dietary approach can dramatically reduce symptoms for many patients.

### The Low FODMAP Diet

FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, And Polyols) are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed and rapidly fermented by gut bacteria, producing gas and drawing water into the intestine.

High FODMAP foods include onions and garlic, wheat and rye, lactose-containing dairy, legumes, apples, pears, watermelon, honey, high fructose corn syrup and sugar alcohols (sorbitol, mannitol).

The low FODMAP diet involves three phases. The elimination phase removes all high FODMAP foods for 2-6 weeks to assess response. The reintroduction phase systematically tests each FODMAP group to identify individual triggers. The personalization phase creates a long-term diet avoiding only identified triggers while maintaining variety.

Research consistently shows the low FODMAP diet improves symptoms in 50-80% of IBS patients<sup>8</sup>. However, it is meant to be a diagnostic tool, not a permanent diet. Long-term strict FODMAP restriction can negatively affect the microbiome by reducing prebiotic fiber intake.

### Identifying Personal Triggers

Beyond FODMAPs, individual triggers vary widely. Keeping a food and symptom diary can help identify patterns. Common non-FODMAP triggers include coffee and caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, fatty foods and artificial sweeteners.

An elimination diet, removing common triggers for several weeks then systematically reintroducing them, can help identify sensitivities. This process is best guided by a healthcare provider to ensure nutritional adequacy.

### Fiber: A Double-Edged Sword

Fiber can be both helpful and harmful in IBS, depending on the type. Soluble fiber (oats, psyllium, cooked vegetables, certain fruits) tends to be well-tolerated and can help regulate bowel movements. It forms a gel-like consistency that softens stool in constipation and adds bulk in diarrhea. Insoluble fiber (wheat bran, raw vegetables, skins of fruits) can worsen symptoms for some IBS patients, particularly those with IBS-C, as it can be harsh on a sensitive gut.

For those with IBS, I typically recommend increasing soluble fiber gradually while being cautious with insoluble fiber. Psyllium husk is particularly well-studied and effective for IBS<sup>9</sup>.

For general fiber information, see my article on [fiber's importance for gut health](/articles/fiber-the-underrated-nutrient).

## Dietary Approaches to IBD

Diet for IBD aims to reduce inflammation, support gut healing and maintain nutritional status during flares.

### Anti-Inflammatory Eating

While no single diet is proven to treat IBD, anti-inflammatory dietary patterns appear beneficial. This includes emphasizing omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish, colorful vegetables and fruits rich in polyphenols, olive oil, turmeric and ginger and bone broth (for collagen and amino acids).

Foods to reduce include processed foods and refined sugars, omega-6-rich vegetable oils, excessive red meat and alcohol.

### Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD)

The Specific Carbohydrate Diet eliminates complex carbohydrates, allowing only monosaccharides (simple sugars). The theory is that complex carbohydrates feed harmful bacteria, perpetuating dysbiosis and inflammation.

Research on SCD shows promising results, with some studies showing remission rates comparable to medication in pediatric Crohn's disease<sup>10</sup>. However, the diet is restrictive and requires commitment.

### Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN)

For Crohn's disease, particularly in children, exclusive enteral nutrition using a liquid elemental or polymeric formula as the only nutrition source has remission rates comparable to corticosteroids but without the side effects<sup>11</sup>. This approach rests the gut, reduces inflammation and improves nutritional status.

While difficult to sustain long-term, periods of EEN can induce remission, after which modified diets can maintain it.

### During Flares

Active IBD flares often require a modified diet to reduce mechanical irritation. This may mean temporarily reducing fiber, avoiding raw vegetables, choosing softer, easily digestible foods and focusing on adequate hydration and nutrition.

The goal during flares is to minimize symptoms while maintaining nutrition. Working with a healthcare provider is important during active disease.

## Supplements and Natural Therapies for IBS

Several supplements and natural approaches have evidence supporting their use in IBS.

### Probiotics

Probiotics can improve IBS symptoms, though effects vary by strain. Multi-strain probiotics generally show better results than single strains. Specific strains with research support include Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and VSL#3 (a multi-strain formulation)<sup>12</sup>.

Benefits may take 4-8 weeks to emerge. Not all probiotics are equal, and strain-specific selection based on symptoms improves outcomes.

### Peppermint Oil

Enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are one of the most well-supported natural treatments for IBS. Peppermint oil has antispasmodic effects that reduce abdominal pain and cramping. Multiple meta-analyses confirm its effectiveness<sup>13</sup>.

Enteric coating is important to prevent heartburn and ensure release in the intestines rather than the stomach.

### Digestive Enzymes

Digestive enzyme supplements may help some IBS patients, particularly those with specific intolerances. Lactase helps those with lactose intolerance. Alpha-galactosidase (Beano) helps digest gas-producing legumes. Broad-spectrum enzymes may improve overall digestion.

### Iberogast

This German herbal formula contains nine plant extracts including bitter candytuft, chamomile, peppermint and others. Research supports its effectiveness for both IBS and functional dyspepsia<sup>14</sup>.

### Herbal Antimicrobials for SIBO

When SIBO is present, herbal antimicrobials can be as effective as antibiotic treatment. Effective herbs include oregano oil, berberine-containing plants (goldenseal, Oregon grape), neem and allicin from garlic. These are typically used in combination for 4-6 weeks. SIBO treatment is best guided by a healthcare provider, as die-off reactions and retreatment may be necessary.

### L-Glutamine

Glutamine is the primary fuel source for intestinal cells and supports gut barrier integrity. Supplementation may help repair increased intestinal permeability and reduce symptoms in some IBS patients<sup>15</sup>.

## Supplements and Natural Therapies for IBD

Natural therapies for IBD should complement, not replace, appropriate medical treatment. However, they can play an important supportive role.

### Curcumin

Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has potent anti-inflammatory effects. Several studies show curcumin can help maintain remission in ulcerative colitis when added to standard therapy<sup>16</sup>. Doses of 2-3 grams daily, often in enhanced-absorption formulations, are typically used.

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Fish oil has anti-inflammatory effects and may help reduce inflammation in IBD. Research results are mixed, but omega-3s are generally safe and have other health benefits. Doses of 2-4 grams of EPA/DHA daily are commonly used.

### Vitamin D

Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD and associated with worse outcomes. Maintaining adequate vitamin D status may help reduce inflammation and support immune regulation<sup>17</sup>. Testing and supplementing to achieve optimal levels (typically 50-80 nmol/L) is recommended.

### Boswellia

Boswellia serrata extract has anti-inflammatory effects and shows promise for ulcerative colitis, with some studies suggesting effectiveness comparable to mesalamine<sup>18</sup>.

### Probiotics for IBD

Certain probiotics have evidence for IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis. VSL#3 is the most studied and has shown benefit for maintaining remission in UC and preventing pouchitis (inflammation of the surgical pouch after colectomy)<sup>19</sup>. E. coli Nissle 1917 has shown results comparable to mesalamine for maintaining UC remission.

Probiotic evidence is stronger for ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease.

## Addressing the Gut-Brain Connection

For both IBS and IBD, addressing the psychological component is essential. This is not about dismissing symptoms as "all in your head." Rather, it recognizes the bidirectional communication between gut and brain.

### Stress Management

Chronic stress worsens both IBS and IBD. Stress affects gut motility, increases intestinal permeability, alters the microbiome and amplifies pain perception.

Effective stress management approaches include mindfulness meditation, yoga, regular exercise, adequate sleep and cognitive behavioral therapy.

### Gut-Directed Hypnotherapy

For IBS specifically, gut-directed hypnotherapy is one of the most effective treatments available, with response rates of 70-80% in research studies<sup>20</sup>. This specialized form of hypnotherapy targets gut function and can provide lasting symptom relief.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

CBT helps patients develop healthier relationships with their symptoms, reduce symptom-focused anxiety and develop coping strategies. It is particularly effective for IBS.

## Working with a Healthcare Provider

Digestive disorders are complex and benefit from professional guidance. A thorough workup should rule out serious conditions, identify underlying factors such as SIBO or food sensitivities and create an individualized treatment plan.

Testing that may be helpful includes comprehensive stool analysis to assess microbiome composition, SIBO breath testing, food sensitivity testing, celiac screening and inflammatory markers such as calprotectin (for IBD vs IBS differentiation).

## Digestive Health Support in Halifax
