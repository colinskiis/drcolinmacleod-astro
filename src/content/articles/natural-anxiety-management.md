## Understanding the Epidemic of Anxiety

Anxiety has become one of the most common mental health concerns of our time. According to the Canadian Mental Health Association, anxiety disorders affect approximately 5% of the population, though many more experience subclinical anxiety symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life<sup>1</sup>. In my naturopathic practice here in Halifax, Nova Scotia, I see patients struggling with anxiety nearly every day. Whether it manifests as persistent worry, physical tension, sleep disturbances or full-blown panic attacks, anxiety can be profoundly debilitating.

What strikes me most is how often patients have been told their anxiety is "just stress" or that medication is their only option. While pharmaceutical interventions certainly have their place and can be life-changing for many people, there is a substantial body of research supporting natural and integrative approaches to anxiety management. These approaches often address underlying physiological factors that contribute to anxious states, offering another pathway toward relief.

The good news is that anxiety is highly treatable. A combination of lifestyle modifications, nutritional interventions, nervous system support and mind-body practices can make a meaningful difference for many people. In this article, I will explore the physiology of anxiety, the factors that contribute to it and the evidence-based natural approaches that can help.

## The Physiology of Anxiety: What Happens in Your Body

To understand how to address anxiety naturally, it helps to understand what actually happens in the body during an anxious response. Anxiety is not simply "in your head." It involves complex interactions between your brain, nervous system, hormones and even your gut.

### The Autonomic Nervous System

Your autonomic nervous system has two main branches. The sympathetic nervous system is often called the "fight or flight" system. When activated, it increases heart rate, dilates pupils, diverts blood flow to muscles and prepares the body for action. The parasympathetic nervous system, by contrast, is the "rest and digest" system that promotes relaxation, digestion and recovery.

In a healthy system, these two branches balance each other. We respond to threats or challenges with sympathetic activation, then return to parasympathetic dominance once the threat passes. The problem with chronic anxiety is that the sympathetic nervous system becomes overactive. The body remains in a state of heightened alertness even when no real threat exists, leading to the persistent physical symptoms many anxious individuals experience, including rapid heartbeat, muscle tension, shallow breathing and digestive upset.

### The HPA Axis and Cortisol

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, commonly called the HPA axis, is the body's central stress response system. When the brain perceives a threat, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone, which signals the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone. This in turn tells the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, the primary stress hormone.

Cortisol serves important functions in the short term. It mobilizes energy, enhances focus and helps the body respond to challenges. However, chronic activation of the HPA axis leads to persistently elevated cortisol levels, which research has linked to anxiety, depression, impaired immune function, weight gain, cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances<sup>2</sup>.

Importantly, the relationship between cortisol and anxiety is bidirectional. Anxiety triggers cortisol release, but elevated cortisol also increases anxiety, creating a self-perpetuating cycle that can be difficult to break without intervention.

### Neurotransmitter Imbalances

Several neurotransmitters play key roles in anxiety. Gamma-aminobutyric acid, known as GABA, is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. It calms neural activity and promotes relaxation. Low GABA activity is associated with anxiety, and many anti-anxiety medications work by enhancing GABA function<sup>3</sup>. Serotonin regulates mood, sleep, appetite and many other functions. Both low serotonin levels and impaired serotonin signaling have been implicated in anxiety disorders. Norepinephrine is involved in the stress response and alertness. Elevated norepinephrine contributes to the physical symptoms of anxiety, including increased heart rate and hypervigilance. Dopamine, while often associated with reward and motivation, also plays a role in anxiety, with both deficiency and excess linked to anxious states depending on the brain region involved.

Understanding these neurochemical factors helps explain why nutritional and lifestyle interventions can be effective. Many natural approaches work by supporting healthy neurotransmitter production and balance.

## The Gut-Brain Connection

One of the most significant advances in our understanding of anxiety over the past decade has been the recognition of the profound connection between gut health and mental health. I have written extensively about [the gut-brain connection](/articles/gut-brain-connection-mental-health) elsewhere, but its relevance to anxiety warrants discussion here.

Your gut contains its own nervous system, the enteric nervous system, with over 100 million neurons. It communicates constantly with your brain through multiple pathways, including the vagus nerve, the immune system and the production of neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules.

The gut microbiome, the trillions of bacteria inhabiting your digestive tract, plays a crucial role in this communication. These bacteria produce neurotransmitters including GABA and serotonin. In fact, approximately 95% of your body's serotonin is produced in the gut<sup>4</sup>. The microbiome also influences inflammation, immune function and the integrity of the gut barrier.

Research has consistently found differences in gut bacteria composition between anxious and non-anxious individuals. Animal studies have demonstrated that altering gut bacteria can change anxiety-related behaviors, and human studies have shown correlations between specific bacterial patterns and anxiety symptoms<sup>5</sup>. This gut-brain axis helps explain why digestive symptoms so often accompany anxiety and why addressing gut health can sometimes significantly improve mental health symptoms.

## Diet, Blood Sugar and Anxiety

What you eat has a more direct impact on anxiety than many people realize. The relationship works through several mechanisms.

### Blood Sugar Stability

When blood sugar drops too low, a condition called hypoglycemia, the body perceives it as a threat and releases stress hormones including cortisol and adrenaline to mobilize stored glucose. These same hormones produce symptoms remarkably similar to anxiety, including shakiness, rapid heartbeat, sweating, irritability and difficulty concentrating.

Many people unknowingly ride a blood sugar roller coaster throughout the day. They consume refined carbohydrates or sugary foods, experience a rapid spike in blood glucose, then crash several hours later as insulin drives blood sugar back down. Each crash triggers stress hormone release and anxiety-like symptoms. Some patients I see in my Halifax practice discover that their "anxiety" is significantly related to blood sugar instability.

Eating balanced meals that include protein, healthy fats and fiber-rich carbohydrates helps maintain more stable blood sugar levels. Avoiding long gaps between meals and reducing intake of refined sugars and processed foods can make a meaningful difference in anxiety symptoms for many individuals.

### Nutrient Status and Neurotransmitter Production

Your brain requires specific nutrients to produce neurotransmitters. B vitamins, including B6, B12 and folate, are essential cofactors in neurotransmitter synthesis. Deficiencies can impair production of serotonin, dopamine and GABA. Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, including those related to nervous system function and stress response. Research suggests that magnesium deficiency is associated with increased anxiety, and supplementation may help reduce symptoms in some individuals<sup>6</sup>. Zinc plays a role in neurotransmitter function and is often depleted during periods of chronic stress. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential components of brain cell membranes and influence neurotransmitter signaling. Low omega-3 status has been associated with anxiety and mood disorders<sup>7</sup>. Iron deficiency can cause symptoms that mimic anxiety, including fatigue, irritability and difficulty concentrating.

A nutrient-dense diet that emphasizes whole foods, vegetables, fruits, quality proteins and healthy fats provides the building blocks necessary for healthy brain function. In some cases, targeted testing can identify specific deficiencies that may be contributing to symptoms.

### Anti-Inflammatory Eating

Chronic inflammation has been increasingly linked to anxiety and depression. Inflammatory cytokines can affect neurotransmitter metabolism, alter brain function and contribute to feelings of malaise and anxiety<sup>8</sup>.

Diets high in processed foods, refined sugars and industrial seed oils tend to promote inflammation. In contrast, whole-food diets rich in vegetables, fruits, omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols from colorful plant foods tend to be anti-inflammatory. The Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes these foods, has been associated with lower rates of anxiety and depression in multiple studies<sup>9</sup>.

## Lifestyle Factors: The Foundation of Anxiety Management

While nutrition plays an important role, lifestyle factors form the foundation upon which all other interventions build. No supplement or treatment can fully compensate for poor sleep, sedentary living or chronic stress.

### Sleep and Anxiety

The relationship between sleep and anxiety is bidirectional and powerful. Anxiety disrupts sleep, making it difficult to fall asleep, stay asleep or achieve restorative deep sleep. Poor sleep in turn increases anxiety the following day, creating a vicious cycle that many patients find difficult to escape.

Research demonstrates that even modest sleep deprivation amplifies anxiety-related activity in brain regions including the amygdala while reducing activity in prefrontal areas that normally regulate emotional responses<sup>10</sup>. Sleep-deprived individuals show heightened physiological stress responses and report more anxiety in response to challenges.

Prioritizing sleep hygiene is therefore essential for anxiety management. I have written more extensively about [evidence-based sleep optimization strategies](/articles/sleep-optimization-evidence-based-strategies) elsewhere. Key principles include maintaining consistent sleep and wake times, creating a dark and cool sleep environment, limiting screen exposure before bed, avoiding caffeine after early afternoon and addressing any underlying sleep disorders such as sleep apnea.

### Exercise and Movement

Physical activity is one of the most powerful and underutilized treatments for anxiety. A 2019 meta-analysis found that exercise significantly reduced anxiety symptoms across a wide range of studies, with effects comparable to medication in some populations<sup>11</sup>.

Exercise works through multiple mechanisms. It reduces levels of stress hormones including cortisol and adrenaline while promoting release of endorphins and other mood-enhancing neurochemicals. It improves sleep quality and enhances resilience to stress. Regular physical activity also appears to promote neuroplasticity and support healthy brain function over time.

The best exercise for anxiety is the exercise you will actually do consistently. Both aerobic exercise and resistance training have shown benefits. Even moderate activity like walking can be helpful, particularly when performed outdoors in nature. For my patients in Halifax, I often recommend taking advantage of the beautiful trails at Point Pleasant Park or along the waterfront. Time spent in natural environments has additional anxiety-reducing effects beyond exercise alone<sup>12</sup>.

### Stress Management and Nervous System Regulation

Learning to regulate your nervous system is perhaps the most important skill for long-term anxiety management. While we cannot eliminate stress from modern life, we can change how our bodies respond to it.

Breathing practices are among the most accessible and effective tools for shifting from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance. Slow, deep breathing with extended exhalation directly activates the vagus nerve and triggers the relaxation response. Even a few minutes of conscious breathing can reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure and decrease subjective anxiety.

Meditation and mindfulness practices have accumulated substantial research support for anxiety reduction. A 2014 meta-analysis found that mindfulness meditation programs had moderate evidence for improving anxiety symptoms<sup>13</sup>. Meditation appears to work by reducing reactivity to stressful stimuli, improving emotional regulation and promoting changes in brain structure and function over time.

Progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, tai chi and other mind-body practices offer additional pathways to nervous system regulation. The key is finding practices that resonate with you and building them into your regular routine.

## The Naturopathic Approach to Assessment

When patients come to see me for anxiety, I take a comprehensive approach to assessment that looks beyond the anxiety itself to understand contributing factors. This includes a detailed health history exploring when anxiety started, what makes it better or worse, associated symptoms, sleep patterns, diet and lifestyle factors, medications and supplements and relevant family history.

Physical examination may reveal signs of nutritional deficiency, thyroid dysfunction or other medical conditions that can cause or worsen anxiety. Laboratory testing, when indicated, might include thyroid function tests since both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause anxiety symptoms, blood sugar markers to assess for glucose dysregulation, nutrient levels such as B12, vitamin D, iron and others, inflammatory markers and hormone levels when hormonal imbalances are suspected.

Functional testing such as comprehensive stool analysis may be appropriate when gut dysfunction is suspected, as digestive symptoms often accompany anxiety and addressing them can improve mental health outcomes.

This thorough assessment allows for individualized treatment that addresses the specific factors contributing to each person's anxiety rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Natural Treatment Approaches

Based on assessment findings, naturopathic treatment for anxiety typically combines several approaches.

### Clinical Nutrition

Dietary interventions form the foundation of treatment. This might involve addressing blood sugar instability through dietary modifications, identifying and removing food sensitivities that may be contributing to inflammation or digestive symptoms, emphasizing anti-inflammatory and nutrient-dense foods, ensuring adequate intake of nutrients important for nervous system function and considering targeted nutritional supplementation when deficiencies are identified.

I offer [clinical nutrition services](/clinical-nutrition) that can help identify dietary factors contributing to anxiety and develop a personalized eating plan to support mental health.

### Herbal Medicine

Botanical medicines have been used for centuries to calm the nervous system and support stress resilience. Many herbs have accumulated research demonstrating their effectiveness for anxiety and stress-related conditions.

Different herbs work through different mechanisms. Some have calming effects on the nervous system, some support healthy cortisol levels and HPA axis function and some work on neurotransmitter systems. The choice of which herbs to use depends on the individual's specific pattern of symptoms and underlying factors.

[Adaptogenic herbs](/articles/adaptogens-for-stress-ashwagandha-rhodiola-and-beyond), which help the body adapt to stress and maintain balance, can be particularly helpful for anxiety that is accompanied by fatigue or exhaustion. Our [herbal medicine services](/herbal-medicine) can help determine which botanical approaches are most appropriate for your situation.

### Acupuncture

Acupuncture has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years to treat a wide range of conditions including anxiety. Modern research has begun to elucidate the mechanisms by which acupuncture may help with anxiety, including modulation of the autonomic nervous system, effects on neurotransmitter levels and reduction of stress hormone release<sup>14</sup>.

Clinical trials have found acupuncture effective for reducing anxiety symptoms in various contexts, including generalized anxiety, pre-operative anxiety and anxiety associated with other medical conditions<sup>15</sup>. Many patients find acupuncture deeply relaxing and appreciate having a treatment approach that does not involve taking anything by mouth.

I offer [acupuncture services](/acupuncture) as part of an integrative approach to anxiety management. Sessions are typically relaxing, and many patients report feeling calmer even after a single treatment.

### Mind-Body Counseling

Beyond specific treatments, naturopathic care often includes education and counseling around stress management, sleep hygiene, exercise and other lifestyle factors. Learning to understand your body's stress response and developing practical tools for nervous system regulation empowers you to manage anxiety more effectively over the long term.

## When to Seek Help

While self-care strategies can be helpful for mild anxiety, there are times when professional support is important. Consider seeking help if anxiety is significantly affecting your work, relationships or quality of life, if you experience panic attacks or severe physical symptoms, if you have thoughts of self-harm, if anxiety persists despite implementing lifestyle changes or if you are using alcohol or other substances to cope with anxiety.

It is also important to rule out medical conditions that can mimic or worsen anxiety. Thyroid disorders, blood sugar dysregulation, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory conditions, medication side effects and other factors can all produce anxiety-like symptoms and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.

Naturopathic care works well alongside conventional treatments when needed. If you are working with a counselor, psychiatrist or other mental health professional, naturopathic approaches can complement their care by addressing physical and lifestyle factors that may be contributing to your symptoms. Open communication between all members of your healthcare team ensures the safest and most effective care.

## Taking the First Step

Anxiety does not have to control your life. While it can feel overwhelming, anxiety is highly treatable and most people can experience significant improvement with appropriate support. The key is addressing anxiety from multiple angles, including nervous system regulation, lifestyle factors, nutrition and underlying physiological imbalances, rather than looking for a single quick fix.

If you are struggling with anxiety and are interested in a comprehensive, natural approach to understanding and managing your symptoms, I invite you to book an initial visit with Dr. Colin MacLeod ND. As a naturopathic doctor serving Halifax and the surrounding communities, I am committed to helping you identify the factors contributing to your anxiety and developing an individualized plan to support your mental health and overall wellbeing.
