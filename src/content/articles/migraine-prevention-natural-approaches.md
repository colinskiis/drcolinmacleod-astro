## More Than Just a Headache

If you have ever experienced a migraine, you know it is nothing like an ordinary headache. The throbbing, pulsating pain that often affects one side of the head can be completely debilitating. Many of my patients in Halifax describe having to retreat to a dark, quiet room for hours or even days, unable to work, care for their families, or participate in life. The World Health Organization ranks migraine as one of the most disabling conditions globally, and for those who experience them frequently, the impact on quality of life is profound<sup>1</sup>.

What makes migraines particularly challenging is their unpredictable nature. While some people experience them rarely, others suffer multiple attacks each month. The economic burden is substantial, with millions of lost workdays and billions in healthcare costs annually. But beyond the statistics lies the very real suffering of individuals who never know when the next attack will strike or how severe it will be.

The good news is that migraines are not simply something you must endure. Understanding the nature of migraines, identifying your personal triggers, and implementing evidence-based prevention strategies can significantly reduce both the frequency and severity of attacks. As a naturopathic doctor, I take a comprehensive approach to migraine prevention that addresses the underlying factors contributing to your susceptibility.

## Understanding the Migraine Brain

Migraines are now understood to be a complex neurological disorder, not simply a blood vessel problem as was once believed. Research has revealed that the migraine brain is inherently more sensitive to changes and stimuli than the non-migraine brain. This heightened sensitivity means that factors which might not affect others, such as weather changes, certain foods, or sleep disruptions, can trigger a cascade of neurological events leading to a migraine attack<sup>2</sup>.

The current understanding involves what researchers call cortical spreading depression, a wave of electrical activity that spreads across the brain's surface. This is followed by activation of the trigeminal nerve, release of inflammatory substances, and ultimately the characteristic pain and associated symptoms. This neurological basis helps explain why migraines are so much more than simple headaches and why they are often accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, visual disturbances, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound.

Understanding that migraines have a genuine neurological basis is important for patients who have sometimes been dismissed or told their condition is not real. Migraines are very real, and the suffering they cause deserves to be taken seriously and treated comprehensively.

## The Four Phases of a Migraine

Recognizing the phases of a migraine can be enormously helpful for prevention and early intervention. Many people are surprised to learn that a migraine is not simply the headache itself but a process that unfolds over hours or even days.

The prodrome phase occurs hours to days before the headache and affects up to 77% of migraine sufferers<sup>3</sup>. During this phase, you might experience subtle warning signs such as mood changes, including feeling unusually irritable, euphoric, or depressed. Food cravings, particularly for sweet or salty foods, are common. You may notice increased thirst and urination, neck stiffness, or unusual fatigue. Some people yawn excessively or feel hyperactive. Recognizing these early warning signs provides a valuable window for intervention, as some prevention strategies are most effective when implemented at the first hint of an approaching migraine.

The aura phase affects approximately 25-30% of migraine sufferers and typically lasts between five and sixty minutes. Visual disturbances are most common, including seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines, blind spots, or shimmering areas. Some people experience sensory auras like tingling or numbness, usually starting in the hand and spreading up the arm to the face. Less commonly, auras may involve speech difficulties or motor weakness. Not everyone with migraines experiences aura, and even those who do may not have it with every attack.

The headache phase is what most people think of as the migraine itself. The pain is typically moderate to severe, often throbbing or pulsating, and frequently affects one side of the head, though it can be bilateral. This phase can last anywhere from four to seventy-two hours without treatment. The headache is usually accompanied by nausea and sometimes vomiting, extreme sensitivity to light, sound, and often smells, as well as worsening of pain with physical activity. Many people need to lie down in a dark, quiet room and may be unable to function normally during this phase.

The postdrome phase is sometimes called the migraine hangover and occurs after the headache resolves. Many people feel exhausted, confused, or generally unwell for up to a day after the headache ends. Some describe it as feeling washed out or fragile. Others experience unusual food cravings or mood changes. This phase is often overlooked but can significantly impact daily functioning.

## Common Migraine Triggers

One of the most powerful tools in migraine prevention is identifying and managing your personal triggers. While triggers vary considerably between individuals, research has identified several common categories that affect many migraine sufferers.

Dietary triggers represent one of the most studied and modifiable categories. Alcohol, particularly red wine, is a trigger for many people. Aged cheeses and fermented foods contain tyramine, which can provoke attacks in susceptible individuals. Processed meats with nitrates and nitrites are problematic for some. Artificial sweeteners, particularly aspartame, have been implicated in migraine triggering. Monosodium glutamate, or MSG, found in many processed and restaurant foods, can be a trigger. Chocolate, though often blamed, may be more complex, as cravings for chocolate during the prodrome phase may lead people to associate it with their migraines when it was actually a symptom rather than a cause. Caffeine presents a nuanced picture, as both excessive consumption and withdrawal can trigger migraines. Skipping meals is a very common trigger, with blood sugar fluctuations playing a significant role.

Hormonal factors are particularly significant for women, who experience migraines at three times the rate of men<sup>4</sup>. The menstrual cycle, particularly the drop in estrogen that occurs just before and during menstruation, is a well-established trigger. Many women notice their migraines begin at puberty and may improve or worsen during pregnancy and menopause. Hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy can affect migraine patterns in either direction.

Sleep disturbances are among the most consistent migraine triggers. Both too little and too much sleep can provoke attacks. Irregular sleep schedules, such as sleeping late on weekends, often trigger migraines. As I discussed in my article on [sleep optimization](/articles/sleep-optimization-evidence-based-strategies), maintaining consistent sleep and wake times is one of the most practical recommendations for health, and this is particularly true for migraine prevention.

Stress is perhaps the most commonly reported trigger, though it is often during the let-down period after stress rather than during the stressful event itself that migraines occur. This explains the phenomenon of weekend or vacation migraines. Managing stress effectively is crucial, and I have written about [natural approaches to stress management](/articles/3-tips-for-combating-stress) that can help.

Environmental factors include weather changes, particularly drops in barometric pressure, which affect many migraine sufferers in Nova Scotia where our maritime climate brings frequent weather fluctuations. Bright or flickering lights, strong odors such as perfumes, cleaning products, or cigarette smoke, and loud noises can all trigger attacks.

Sensory overload from any source can overwhelm the sensitive migraine brain. This includes prolonged screen time, noisy crowded environments, and situations combining multiple sensory inputs.

## The Role of Food Sensitivities

Beyond the commonly recognized dietary triggers, many people with migraines have underlying food sensitivities that contribute to their attacks. These sensitivities are different from food allergies and often go unrecognized because symptoms may not appear immediately after eating the offending food.

Food sensitivities involve a delayed immune response that can cause inflammation and trigger migraines hours or even days after consumption. This delayed reaction makes it difficult to identify problem foods through observation alone. Common culprits include gluten, dairy, eggs, soy, corn, and citrus, though the specific foods vary considerably between individuals.

An elimination diet, where suspect foods are removed for a period of time and then systematically reintroduced while monitoring symptoms, remains one of the most reliable ways to identify food sensitivities. This process requires patience and careful tracking but can be transformative for those whose migraines are connected to their diet.

Research supports the connection between food sensitivities and migraines. Studies have found that identifying and eliminating trigger foods can significantly reduce migraine frequency in many patients<sup>5</sup>. This is an area where [clinical nutrition](/clinical-nutrition) plays a vital role, as working with someone experienced in elimination protocols and food sensitivity identification can make the process more effective and less overwhelming.

## Lifestyle Modifications for Prevention

The migraine brain thrives on regularity. Maintaining consistent patterns in sleep, meals, exercise, and stress management creates a stable environment that is less likely to trigger attacks.

Regular sleep habits are foundational. Going to bed and waking at the same time each day, even on weekends, helps regulate the body's internal clock. Aim for seven to eight hours of quality sleep in a dark, cool, quiet room. Avoiding screens for an hour before bed and establishing a calming bedtime routine supports better sleep quality.

Consistent meal timing helps prevent blood sugar fluctuations that can trigger migraines. Eating regular meals and not skipping breakfast or going long periods without food provides steady fuel for the brain. Staying well-hydrated is equally important, as even mild dehydration can trigger attacks in susceptible individuals.

Regular physical activity has been shown to reduce migraine frequency, likely through effects on stress hormones, sleep quality, and overall nervous system regulation<sup>6</sup>. However, intense exercise can itself be a trigger for some people, so finding the right type and intensity of activity is important. Low-impact exercise like walking, swimming, or yoga is often well-tolerated. Starting gradually and building up slowly is advisable for those who are new to exercise or who find that physical activity sometimes triggers their migraines.

Stress management is crucial given the strong connection between stress and migraines. Regular practice of relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation can help regulate the nervous system and reduce migraine susceptibility. Even brief daily practice can make a difference over time.

## The Naturopathic Approach to Migraine Prevention

Naturopathic medicine is particularly well-suited to migraine prevention because of its focus on identifying and addressing underlying causes rather than simply suppressing symptoms. When I work with migraine patients in my Halifax practice, I take a comprehensive approach that considers all the factors that may be contributing to their condition.

The initial assessment involves a detailed health history that explores not just the characteristics of your migraines but your overall health picture. This includes digestive function, hormonal health, sleep patterns, stress levels, and diet and lifestyle habits. Understanding the full context often reveals contributing factors that would otherwise be missed.

Identifying individual triggers through careful history-taking and sometimes elimination protocols helps create a personalized prevention plan. What triggers one person's migraines may be perfectly tolerable for another, so generic advice about avoiding certain foods or activities is often insufficient.

Addressing underlying imbalances is central to the naturopathic approach. This might involve supporting hormonal balance, optimizing digestive function, addressing nutrient deficiencies, or supporting stress resilience through adaptogenic herbs. Many patients are surprised to discover that seemingly unrelated health issues are connected to their migraines.

Nutritional support plays an important role, as several nutrients have research supporting their use in migraine prevention. Rather than recommending specific supplements without proper assessment, I evaluate each patient's individual needs through detailed history and sometimes laboratory testing. This ensures that any nutritional interventions are appropriate and effective for that person's unique situation.

[Herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine) offers various options for migraine prevention and support. Botanical medicines can address underlying contributors such as stress, hormonal imbalances, or inflammation. The specific herbs used depend on the individual's presentation and overall health picture, which is why working with a qualified practitioner is important rather than self-prescribing based on general recommendations.

## Acupuncture for Migraine Prevention

Acupuncture has accumulated substantial evidence for migraine prevention. A Cochrane systematic review, which represents the highest level of evidence synthesis, concluded that acupuncture is at least as effective as preventive drug treatments for migraine, with fewer adverse effects<sup>7</sup>.

The mechanisms by which acupuncture helps prevent migraines are not fully understood but likely involve modulation of pain pathways in the nervous system, effects on neurotransmitter balance, reduction in inflammation, and promotion of endorphin release. Acupuncture also promotes relaxation and can help address muscle tension in the neck and shoulders that often accompanies or contributes to migraines.

In my practice, I use [acupuncture](/acupuncture) as part of a comprehensive migraine prevention strategy. Treatment typically involves regular sessions initially, gradually reducing frequency as improvement occurs. Many patients find that acupuncture not only reduces their migraine frequency but also helps them feel more relaxed and resilient overall.

The research on acupuncture for migraine prevention is encouraging. Studies have shown that regular acupuncture treatment can reduce both the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks<sup>8</sup>. For patients who prefer to minimize medication use, or for whom medications are contraindicated or ineffective, acupuncture offers a valuable alternative or complementary approach.

## The Importance of a Headache Diary

Keeping a detailed headache diary is one of the most useful tools for migraine prevention. Recording when migraines occur, their severity and duration, potential triggers, and what helped or did not help creates a valuable dataset for identifying patterns and refining your prevention strategy.

A good headache diary should include the date and time of onset, the duration of the attack, the severity of pain on a scale of one to ten, the location and quality of the pain, any associated symptoms such as nausea, visual disturbances, or sensitivity to light and sound, and any medications or other interventions used and their effectiveness.

Equally important is tracking potential triggers in the twenty-four to forty-eight hours before the migraine. This includes what you ate and drank, how you slept, your stress levels, weather changes, hormonal factors for menstruating women, and any unusual exposures or activities.

Over time, patterns often emerge that would not be apparent from memory alone. You might discover that your migraines tend to occur after eating certain foods, after poor sleep, or during specific phases of your menstrual cycle. This information is invaluable for creating an effective prevention plan.

## When to Seek Help

While occasional migraines may be manageable with self-care and over-the-counter medications, there are situations where professional help is important.

You should seek medical evaluation if you are experiencing new or different headaches, especially if you are over fifty years old. A sudden severe headache that is the worst of your life requires immediate medical attention. Headaches accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking also warrant urgent evaluation.

For chronic migraine management, professional help is valuable if you are experiencing migraines more than four days per month, if your migraines are significantly impacting your quality of life, if over-the-counter medications are not providing adequate relief, or if you are using acute medications frequently, which can lead to medication overuse headache.

## A Comprehensive Approach to Migraine Freedom

Migraine prevention is rarely about finding one magic solution. Instead, it involves understanding your unique triggers and patterns, making appropriate lifestyle modifications, addressing underlying health imbalances, using targeted natural therapies, and developing a comprehensive management plan.

Many of my patients who initially felt hopeless about their migraines have achieved significant improvement through this comprehensive approach. Some have reduced their migraine frequency from weekly to monthly or even less. Others have shortened the duration of attacks or reduced their severity. The key is taking migraines seriously as a real medical condition and committing to the detective work required to understand and address your individual contributing factors.
