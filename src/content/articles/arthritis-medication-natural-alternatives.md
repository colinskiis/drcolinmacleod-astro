## Arthritis Medications: NSAIDs
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, arthrotec, etc. are the conventional first line treatment to help patients deal with joint pain associated with osteoarthritis. Although NSAIDs effectively reduce pain, they have some significant adverse effects. These adverse effects include digestive tract irritation and [stomach bleeding](http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/148/2/281?ijKey=dd44a3afb03ed3fd97b22c67e32836cf5981ebfc&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha)<sup>2</sup>, [kidney toxicity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15847359)<sup>3</sup>, and most importantly in the case of osteoarthritis, [accelerated joint destruction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16200593)<sup>4</sup>.
Several [high-](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8991995)[quality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/858<sup>[7](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2570233)</sup>086) [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2570233)<sup>[5,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8991995)</sup><sup>[6,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8587086)</sup>7 have now shown NSAID usage to be associated with an increased rate of destruction of joints in patients with arthritis, however this association is still relatively unknown to the medical community. It is thought that the increased joint destruction is due to either excessive joint usage (due to decreased pain sensation) or a direct destructive effect of these drugs on the cartilage and bone of the affected joints. Regardless of the mechanism, worsening joint erosion is a very detrimental adverse effect since it causes actual progression of the condition that is being treated. Although pain management is important in osteoarthritis there are other, more natural treatments with [similar efficacy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3318445)<sup>8</sup> and less adverse effects.

## Natural Treatments For Arthritis
In osteoarthritis-induced pain there are several treatments which help to reduce joint pain and in some cases even improve the integrity of the joint and strength of surrounding bone. As a naturopathic doctor and a research-based practitioner I prefer to use treatments which have minimal adverse effects and optimal treatment efficacy. In osteoarthritis several non-drug treatments can have powerful effects including weight loss, specific exercises, [acupuncture](https://drcolinmacleod.com/acupuncture-injury-pain), specific herbs and supplements. Each person is unique in which joints are affected and the level of severity and for this reason treatment recommendations differ from person to person.
In my practice I have seen encouraging results with natural treatment combinations targeting weight loss, restoring muscle strength and restoring joint integrity. If you suffer from arthritis and are interested in natural treatment options you can call MacLeod Naturopathic at 902-820-2727 to book an initial consultation.
