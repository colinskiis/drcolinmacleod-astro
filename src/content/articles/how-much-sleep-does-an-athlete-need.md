Nutrition and training are front and centre in the minds of competitive athletes. However, there is more that needs to be done to optimize performance and maintain health.

Sleep is often a missing piece of the puzzle<sup>1</sup> for competitive athletes. The research is clear: loss of sleep will weaken your athletic performance in the short and long-term. Let's take a more in-depth look.

## Short-term Sleep Deprivation

Research has shown that short-term sleep loss has negative effects on many aspects of athletic performance including strength, endurance, accuracy, speed and reaction time.

### Strength, Power

While weight lifters who lose one night's sleep may maintain normal strength levels<sup>2</sup>, getting three consecutive nights of poor sleep (3 hours per night) significantly reduces maximal and submaximal lifts, with maximal bench press decreasing 20lbs on average<sup>3</sup>. In another study Judo competitors also had significantly reduced performance<sup>4</sup> on strength tests after a single night of poor sleep.

### Endurance

After 30 hours without sleep, healthy young men had a significantly reduced time to exhaustion<sup>5</sup> during 75% maximal effort bicycling and decreased treadmill endurance<sup>6</sup> during a self-paced treadmill test. Sleep deprivation of 36 hours also reduced endurance performance<sup>7</sup> while treadmill walking at 80% VO<sub>2</sub>max. Additionally, highly trained endurance athletes with 3 hours of sleep loss had an increased heart rate<sup>8</sup> while cycling at 75% VO<sub>2</sub>max, which suggests that their body was working harder to achieve the same level of performance.

### Accuracy

A study of dart players found that after one night of 3-4 hours sleep they were significantly less accurate<sup>9</sup> compared to those having a full 7-8 hour night's sleep. Another study found that college basketball players had a 9% improvement in free throw accuracy<sup>10</sup> after increasing sleep to at least 10 hours per night over 5-7 weeks. Semi-professional tennis players had a significant decrease in serving accuracy<sup>11</sup> after a single night of only 5 hours of sleep compared to their standard night's sleep (7-8 hours). Rugby players showed decreased passing accuracy<sup>12</sup> after having a single poor night's sleep (3-5 hours). Also, soldiers' marksmanship dropped to only 16%<sup>13</sup> of their usual accuracy after remaining awake for 3 days.

### Speed

Sprinters' acceleration, maximum speed and submaximal sprint times<sup>14</sup> were all negatively affected after missing one night's sleep. In another study college basketball players who increased the amount they slept each night by 2 hours (on average) over a 5-7 week period also had significantly faster sprint times<sup>10</sup>. Another interesting study found that while a night's sleep of just 4 hours resulted in significantly slower sprints; sprint speed could be recovered<sup>15</sup> if the runner took a half-hour nap earlier in the day to recoup lost sleep.

### Reaction Time

Reaction time, another important factor in athletic performance, is also impacted by poor sleep. Most research on reaction time has been done in a laboratory setting, being measured with tasks which are not physically or mentally demanding.

More *realistic, real-world* tests reveal that sleep deprivation has a powerful effect on reaction time and decision making abilities. A large review of real life, military operations-based tests found that sleep deprivation leads to "lack of innovation, inflexibility of thought processes... over-reliance on previous strategies, unwillingness to try out novel strategies… and inability to deal with surprise and the unexpected."<sup>16</sup> In the world of sports, split-second decision making is the difference between holding the upper hand and losing it. For this reason poorer reaction time can hurt an athlete's performance significantly.

## Long-term Sleep Deprivation

While exercise in general is an important factor in maintaining good quality sleep, elite level athletes tend to have more sleep problems<sup>17</sup> than the average person. Overreaching and overtraining can also result from long-term sleep deficits, leading to poor performance and a myriad of health issues including depression, fatigue and immune system suppression<sup>17,18</sup>. With this in mind athletes must make efforts to maintain ideal sleep habits for performance and health maintenance.

## How Much Sleep Does An Athlete Need?

An excellent guide for athlete sleep requirements<sup>19</sup> was released by Canadian Sports For Life in 2013. From 15 years of age and older this guideline recommends that athletes get 8-10 hours of sleep per night with an additional 30 minutes of sleep in the form of a nap between 2:00-4:00pm. However, aiming for 10 hours of sleep per day in total is likely to provide optimal performance benefits compared to 8 hours per day.

## Improving Sleep

Optimizing numbers of hours slept and sleep quality should be a goal near the top of the list for competitive athletes. Sleep can often be improved by making small changes in sleep hygiene such as keeping the bedroom dark, avoiding screen time before bedtime and decluttering the bedroom. Naturopathic treatments such as clinical nutrition, herbal medicine and acupuncture also offer an excellent means of improving sleep beyond basic sleep hygiene changes.
