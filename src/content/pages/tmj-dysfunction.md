Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction is a disorder that affects the jaw joint, causing pain and discomfort in the jaw, face, neck and head. TMJ dysfunction is a common problem, with an estimated 11 million North Americans affected.

The temporomandibular joint is a hinge joint that connects the lower jaw (mandible) to the temporal bone of the skull. It is a complex joint, with multiple components including muscles, ligaments, bones, and cartilage. The specific components of the joint include the joint capsule, articular disc, mandibular condyles, articular surface of the temporal bone, temporomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, stylomandibular ligament and the lateral pterygoid muscle.

## Symptoms of TMJ Dysfunction

Generally, the most common symptom of TMJ dysfunction is pain and tenderness in the jaw area, especially when opening the mouth or chewing. Other symptoms may include headaches, earaches, clicking or popping noises in the jaw joint, difficulty opening the mouth fully, and locking of the jaw.

## Risk Factors for TMJ Dysfunction

Risk factors for TMJ dysfunction can be divided into two categories – physical and psychological. Physical risk factors for TMJ dysfunction include malocclusion of the teeth (not having the top and bottom teeth fit together correctly), grinding of the teeth, trauma to the jaw, arthritis and wearing a dental appliance such as a mouthguard.

Stress, anxiety and depression are psychological risk factors for TMJ dysfunction. Psychological stress and mental health problems can lead to clenching and grinding of the teeth, which can cause wear and tear on the temporomandibular joint. It is important to note that not everyone with these risk factors will develop TMJ dysfunction. If you are experiencing any of the symptoms of TMJ dysfunction, it is important to seek medical attention to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

## Treatments for TMJ Dysfunction

Treatments for Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) dysfunction can be divided into two broad categories: conservative treatments and surgical treatments.

Conservative treatments focus on reducing the symptoms of TMJ dysfunction without resorting to surgery. These treatments may include lifestyle changes such as avoiding hard or chewy foods, managing teeth grinding (bruxism), and taking over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Targeted exercise-based treatments can help to condition the muscles surrounding the temporomandibular joint which can help pain and improve the range of motion of the joint.

Surgical treatment may include arthrocentesis, which involves draining excess fluid from the joint; arthroscopy, which involves using a tiny camera and specialized tools to access the joint and make repairs; and joint replacement surgery, which involves removing the damaged joint and replacing it with an artificial joint. No matter which type of treatment is chosen for TMJ dysfunction, the goal is to reduce pain, improve range of motion, and improve overall quality of life.

## Naturopathic Treatment for TMJ Dysfunction

Prolotherapy and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) have both been used as treatment for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. Prolotherapy is an injection of a concentrated dextrose (sugar) solution into an affected joint, which stimulates the body to repair connective tissue and strengthen the joint. It can be used to reduce pain and improve joint function. PRP is an injection of a concentrated solution of a person's own platelets and blood plasma, which encourages the repair process of the affected joint.

Prolotherapy is an effective treatment for reducing pain and improving range of motion in TMJ dysfunction and has an excellent safety profile<sup>1-5</sup>. PRP is also been used to treat TMJ dysfunction and has been shown in several studies to improve the associated pain and limited range of motion<sup>6-10</sup>.

Both prolotherapy and PRP are safe, minimally invasive treatments and excellent options for people with TMJ dysfunction.
