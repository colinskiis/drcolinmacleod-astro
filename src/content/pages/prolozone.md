## What Is Prolozone?

Prolozone therapy is an injection treatment for acute and chronic painful conditions. Prolozone is used to treat a variety of painful conditions from osteoarthritis, to tendonitis, to plantar fasciitis. This treatment involves the injection of a natural anti-inflammatory combination directly into an affected joint. The main active ingredient of the injection is an oxygen/ozone gas mixture.

## How Does Prolozone Work?

The combination of oxygen and ozone when injected has a two-fold effect on the target tissue. The ozone itself increases [oxygen utilization](/ozone-therapy) while the oxygen directly increases the [oxygen concentration](/ozone-therapy) of the tissue. This one-two punch significantly increases the rate of healing of the affected area and typically reduces pain within a short period of time. Ozone is also a mild irritant and when injected it causes a proliferative effect on the target tissue which aides in joint repair.

## What Conditions Does Prolozone Help?

The painful conditions which prolozone helps most are chronic degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease. Arthritis of the knee and hip, vertebral degeneration and frozen shoulder are a few conditions which I have seen respond well to prolozone treatment.

Some of the conditions which have shown good results in clinical trials with prolozone treatment include osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, radiculopathy, low back pain<sup>3,4,5</sup> and herniated disc<sup>6,7</sup>. Clinical trials have also shown very good results with prolozone in the treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction<sup>8</sup>.

## How Will I Feel After A Prolozone Treatment?

Typically within a few hours of having a prolozone treatment people will feel an improvement in their pain. Within 24 hours of a treatment most cases show decreased pain and there may be an improved range of motion of the joint. In some cases the treated joint may feel stiff after the treatment for a few hours but this stiffness will be short-lived and is most often followed by an overall pain reduction.

## Are Prolozone Injections Safe?

Yes, when administered by a properly trained practitioner prolozone injections are very safe. However, those who have had a prosthetic joint replacement can not receive a prolozone treatment into the joint.

## Does Prolozone Hurt?

Prolozone injections are a bit more uncomfortable than an acupuncture needle but not much more. I was trained in the use of ozone therapy and prolozone injections with [Dr. Frank Shallenberger](https://www.antiagingmedicine.com/), a holistic medical doctor practicing in Reno, Nevada who is a foremost educator in medical ozone. Dr. Shallenberger says that the pain is "like a mosquito with an attitude."

## How Many Treatments Will I Need?

Depending on the health issue which is being treated a different number of prolozone treatments will be required. Most painful conditions respond very well within 6 treatments at a rate of 1 treatment every 2-4 weeks. After 6 treatments a maintenance phase begins with 1 treatment being given every month to every 3 months. With advanced osteoarthritis patients will typically need ongoing prolozone treatments every 6-8 weeks to maintain optimal mobility, range of motion and to eliminate or minimize pain.
