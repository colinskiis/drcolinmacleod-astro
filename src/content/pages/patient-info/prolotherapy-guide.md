# Prolotherapy Patient Information

Prolotherapy is a proven regenerative injection therapy that stimulates the body's natural healing response to strengthen weakened joints, ligaments, and tendons.

## What is Prolotherapy?

Prolotherapy involves injecting a concentrated dextrose (sugar) solution directly into damaged or weakened connective tissue. This triggers a controlled inflammatory response that:

- **Stimulates collagen production** - strengthens ligaments and tendons
- **Promotes tissue regeneration** - repairs damaged structures  
- **Increases joint stability** - reduces pain and improves function
- **Activates growth factors** - accelerates natural healing

## Conditions Treated with Prolotherapy

### Joint Conditions
- **Osteoarthritis** (knees, hips, shoulders, spine)
- **Joint instability** and hypermobility
- **Chronic joint pain** not responding to other treatments
- **Sports-related joint injuries**

### Ligament and Tendon Injuries
- **Tennis elbow** and golfer's elbow
- **Plantar fasciitis** 
- **Achilles tendinitis**
- **Rotator cuff injuries**
- **Chronic sprains and strains**

### Spinal Conditions
- **Low back pain** with ligament laxity
- **Sacroiliac joint dysfunction**
- **Cervical spine instability**
- **Chronic neck pain**

## Success Rates and Research

- **85% success rate** for osteoarthritis treatment
- **Significant pain reduction** in clinical studies
- **Long-lasting results** - often years of symptom relief
- **Reduced need** for pain medications and surgery

## Before Your Prolotherapy Treatment

### 1 Week Before
- **Stop anti-inflammatory medications** (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin)
- **Continue other medications** unless specifically instructed otherwise
- **Avoid corticosteroid injections** (discuss timing with Dr. MacLeod)
- **Maintain normal activity** levels

### Day of Treatment
- **Eat a light meal** before your appointment
- **Wear comfortable, loose clothing** with easy access to treatment area
- **Bring a driver** if treating multiple sites
- **Take prescribed pre-medications** if recommended

## The Prolotherapy Procedure

### Treatment Process
1. **Area preparation** - cleaning and sterilization
2. **Local anesthetic** - to minimize discomfort during injections
3. **Precise injection** - dextrose solution into specific ligament/tendon attachments
4. **Multiple injection sites** - comprehensive treatment of affected area
5. **Post-treatment assessment** - movement and comfort evaluation

### During Treatment
- **Mild to moderate discomfort** during injections (brief)
- **Pressure sensation** as solution is injected
- **Treatment time:** 15-30 minutes depending on area treated
- **Immediate walking** and basic movement encouraged

## After Your Prolotherapy Treatment

### First 24-48 Hours
- **Some soreness is normal** - indicates healing response activation
- **Apply ice** for 10-15 minutes if needed for comfort
- **Gentle movement** encouraged - avoid complete rest
- **Tylenol/acetaminophen** for pain relief (avoid anti-inflammatories)

### First Week Post-Treatment
- **Gradual return** to normal activities
- **Avoid strenuous exercise** for 3-5 days
- **Continue gentle stretching** and range of motion
- **Stay well hydrated** to support healing

### 2-4 Weeks Post-Treatment
- **Healing response peaks** during this period
- **Improved strength and stability** begin to develop
- **Return to exercise** as tolerated
- **Next treatment** typically scheduled during this timeframe

## Treatment Series and Timeline

### Typical Treatment Protocol
- **Initial series:** 3-6 treatments
- **Treatment interval:** Every 2-4 weeks
- **Assessment period:** 2-3 months after series completion
- **Maintenance treatments:** As needed (often 6-12 months later)

### Healing Timeline
- **Immediate:** Inflammatory healing response activated
- **2-6 weeks:** New collagen formation begins
- **6-12 weeks:** Tissue strengthening becomes apparent
- **3-6 months:** Maximum benefit typically achieved

## Factors Affecting Treatment Success

### Positive Factors
- **Adequate nutrition** - especially protein and vitamin C
- **Proper rest** between treatments
- **Appropriate activity** modification
- **Patient age** - younger patients often respond faster
- **Non-smoking** status

### Limiting Factors
- **Continued anti-inflammatory use**
- **Severe arthritis** with bone-on-bone contact
- **Poor nutrition** or general health
- **Smoking** - significantly impairs healing
- **Unrealistic activity levels** during healing

## Safety and Side Effects

### Common (Expected) Effects
- **Post-injection soreness** - 1-7 days (mild to moderate)
- **Temporary stiffness** - resolves within days
- **Slight swelling** at injection sites

### Rare Side Effects
- **Infection** - extremely rare with sterile technique
- **Nerve irritation** - temporary, resolves quickly
- **Allergic reaction** - very rare with dextrose solution

### When to Contact Us
- **Severe pain** that worsens after 48 hours
- **Signs of infection** (fever, increasing redness, warmth)
- **Numbness or tingling** that persists
- **Any concerns** about your response to treatment

## Maximizing Your Results

### Lifestyle Factors
- **Maintain good nutrition** - adequate protein for tissue building
- **Stay hydrated** - supports healing processes
- **Get adequate sleep** - essential for tissue repair
- **Manage stress** - chronic stress impairs healing

### Exercise Guidelines

- **Gradual return** to normal activities over 1 week
- **Avoid high-impact activities** during healing periods
- **Strengthening exercises** as recommended by Dr. MacLeod
