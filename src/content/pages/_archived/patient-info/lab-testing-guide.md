# Preparing for Your Lab Tests

This guide covers what you need to know before your blood draw or sample collection. For information about available tests and what they reveal, see our [Laboratory Testing](/lab-testing) page.

## General Preparation

**Before your appointment:**
- Follow any fasting instructions provided during your consultation
- Stay hydrated. Drink water normally (water doesn't break a fast)
- Bring a list of all medications and supplements you're currently taking
- Wear clothing with sleeves that roll up easily for blood draws
- Bring a snack to eat after your blood draw

## Fasting Tests

Some tests require a 12-hour fast for accurate results. If your requisition indicates fasting:

- Stop eating after 8 PM the night before
- Water is allowed and encouraged. Stay hydrated
- Black coffee or plain tea is generally acceptable, but confirm with our office
- Take your regular medications unless specifically instructed otherwise
- Schedule a morning appointment (7-10 AM) when possible
- Bring a snack to eat immediately after your blood draw

**Common tests requiring fasting:**
- Lipid panel (cholesterol, triglycerides)
- Fasting glucose and fasting insulin
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- Iron studies (for most accurate ferritin results)

## Hormone Testing

Hormone levels fluctuate based on time of day, menstrual cycle, and other factors. Timing matters for accurate results.

**For menstruating women:**
- Progesterone: Test on days 19-21 of your cycle (about 7 days after ovulation)
- FSH and LH: Test on days 2-4 of your cycle
- Estrogen: Can be tested at various points; we'll specify based on your situation

**For cortisol testing:**
- Blood cortisol: Draw before 9 AM for morning cortisol assessment
- Saliva cortisol: Collect samples at specified times (typically waking, noon, evening, bedtime)
- Avoid strenuous exercise the morning of testing
- Try to maintain your normal sleep schedule the night before

**For thyroid testing:**
- Morning draws (before 10 AM) are preferred
- If you take thyroid medication, have your blood drawn before taking your morning dose
- Fasting is not required for thyroid tests alone

## Stool Testing

For comprehensive stool analysis:

- Avoid antibiotics for 2 weeks before collection (unless medically essential)
- Stop probiotics 48 hours before collection
- Maintain your normal diet. Don't change eating patterns
- Follow collection kit instructions carefully
- Samples must be collected and returned within the timeframe specified

## At-Home Collection Tests

For saliva or urine hormone tests (like the DUTCH test):

- Read all instructions before beginning collection
- Note the specific timing requirements for each sample
- Store samples as directed (some require refrigeration)
- Complete the collection within the specified timeframe
- Ship samples promptly using the provided materials

## After Your Blood Draw

- Keep the bandage on for at least 15-30 minutes
- Avoid heavy lifting with that arm for a few hours
- Eat your snack and drink water
- Light bruising at the draw site is normal and will resolve

## Results Timeline

- **Standard blood work:** 5-7 business days
- **Specialty hormone panels (DUTCH):** 2-3 weeks
- **Comprehensive stool analysis:** 2-3 weeks
- **Food sensitivity panels:** 2-3 weeks

Once results are available, we'll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to review findings and discuss recommendations.
