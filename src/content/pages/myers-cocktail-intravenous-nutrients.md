## What Is A Myers' Cocktail?

The Myers' Cocktail is a combination of Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, Vitamin C, magnesium and calcium administered intravenously. The Myers' Cocktail was first performed by Dr. John Myers MD and later championed by Dr. Alan Gaby MD after Myers' death in 1984<sup>1</sup>.

| Nutrient | Function |
|----------|----------|
| Calcium | Maintains strength of cartilage and bone |
| Magnesium | Muscle contraction, relaxation and blood flow |
| Vitamin B1 | Nerve signaling and energy maintenance |
| Vitamin B2 | Prevention of migraines and energy maintenance |
| Vitamin B3 | Balancing of sex hormones: testosterone and estrogen |
| Vitamin B5 | Adrenal hormone production; muscle and skin repair |
| Vitamin B6 | Clear mental functioning and energy maintenance |
| Vitamin C | Joint cartilage health and immune system function |

The Myers' Cocktail works by increasing the blood concentration of several essential vitamins and minerals beyond that which can be achieved when supplementing orally. For example, Vitamin C given intravenously has been found to reach blood concentrations more than 50 times higher<sup>2</sup> than what can be achieved when given orally.

## Conditions Treated by the Myers' Cocktail

Dr. Alan Gaby MD has published a review<sup>1</sup> of his experience of treating 800-1,000 patients with the Myers' Cocktail over 11 years, giving a total of approximately 15,000 infusions. Some of the conditions which he found to be managed well by this treatment include acute asthma attacks, migraines, fatigue, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, acute muscle spasm, upper respiratory tract infections, chronic sinusitis, seasonal allergies and cardiovascular disease. He also observed improvements in athletic performance.

One component of the Myers' Cocktail, Magnesium, is something that many people are deficient in<sup>3</sup>. Having low levels of magnesium has been linked to several health conditions, including ischemic heart disease<sup>4</sup>, migraines<sup>5</sup> and type 2 diabetes<sup>6</sup>. Recent research has also found that magnesium is useful in treating hypertension<sup>7</sup>, acute migraines<sup>8</sup> and acute myocardial infarction<sup>9</sup>. Another component of the mixture, Vitamin C, has fatigue-reducing<sup>10</sup>, antiviral<sup>11</sup> activity and is useful in improving quality of life in cancer patients<sup>12</sup>, when given intravenously. While each of the nutrients present in the Myers' Cocktail has a unique action in the body their combination will typically correct nutrient deficiencies, boost energy and improve immune function.

## Clinical Experience With the Myers' Cocktail

I have found that the Myers' Cocktail has been a very helpful treatment for several health conditions including Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, upper respiratory infections and post-viral fatigue. When treating other conditions, including heart disease, peripheral artery disease, cancer and post-concussion symptoms I will use a different combination of nutrients but still retain many of the core ingredients of the Myers' Cocktail. The Myers' Cocktail is also quite beneficial for athletic performance but an individualized intravenous nutrient treatment is the most reliable way to increase athletic performance.

My experience with this treatment is that after getting the IV patients will often feel a boost of energy, increased ability to fight off a lingering infection and patients with fibromyalgia may experience a decrease of fatigue and pain for 1-3 weeks.

## Safety of the Myers' Cocktail

There are no documented major adverse effects of Myers' Cocktail infusions. Available safety data has reported mild adverse effects and overall excellent tolerability<sup>13</sup>. In practice the most common adverse effects I have observed include lightheadedness, low blood pressure and discomfort at the site of infusion. The lightheadedness which patients experience is typically brief and transient, as is lowering of blood pressure, while pain at the infusion site is easily preventable with modification of administration speed or solution concentration.
