## Specialized Laboratory Testing

Laboratory testing is an essential tool for assessing metabolism, digestive health, toxicity, nutrient levels, and the presence of chronic infections. Dr. MacLeod uses advanced testing to identify root causes and guide effective treatment.

### Digestive Health Testing

Stool analysis is an invaluable, non-invasive diagnostic assessment that helps pinpoint the causes of gastrointestinal symptoms and chronic systemic conditions.

**What we test for:**
- Digestion and absorption markers
- Beneficial and pathogenic bacteria
- Parasites and yeasts
- Inflammation levels
- Food sensitivities

Stool testing guides treatment for conditions including IBS, IBD, autoimmune disease, food sensitivities, and unexplained digestive symptoms.

### Metal Toxicity Testing

Chronic, low-level exposure to toxic metals is more common than acute poisoning and can result in significant health issues.

**Toxic metals we test for:**
- Lead
- Mercury
- Cadmium
- Arsenic
- Aluminum

Testing is performed by analyzing urine levels after administration of a chelation agent (EDTA, DMSA, or DMPS), which mobilizes metals from tissue stores for accurate measurement.

---

### Nutrient Status Testing

A healthy balance of vitamins, minerals, and cofactors is essential for optimal physical and mental health.

**What we assess:**
- Vitamin levels (B vitamins, D, A, E, C)
- Mineral status (magnesium, zinc, selenium, iron)
- Essential fatty acids
- Amino acids
- Antioxidant capacity

Identifying deficiencies allows for targeted supplementation and dietary changes to restore optimal nutrient levels.

### Chronic Infection Testing

Chronic infections can cause many health problems and are often misdiagnosed. We test for:

- Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi)
- Co-infections (Bartonella, Babesia, Anaplasma)
- Viral infections (EBV, HSV, CMV)
- Bacterial infections (Chlamydia, Mycoplasma)
- Fungal overgrowth (Candida, Aspergillus)

With proper assessment, even long-standing cases of chronic infection can be effectively treated.
